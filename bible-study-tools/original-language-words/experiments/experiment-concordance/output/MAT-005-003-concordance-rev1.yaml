# === NOTES (minimal) ===
notes:
  - note: "The article (G3588) appears four times in this verse (positions 2, 4, 9, 11), reflecting standard Greek grammar for noun phrases and prepositional phrases." {llm-cs45}
  - note: "πτωχοὶ (G4434) literally means those who crouch/cower, denoting absolute poverty and dependency, not merely being financially poor." {llm-cs45}
  - note: "οὐρανῶν (heavens) appears in genitive plural form, following Matthew's characteristic phrase 'kingdom of the heavens' rather than 'kingdom of God' used in other gospels." {llm-cs45}
