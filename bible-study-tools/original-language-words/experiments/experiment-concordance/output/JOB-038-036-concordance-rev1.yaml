# === NOTES (minimal) ===
notes:
  - note: "H7907 (שֶׂכְוִי) is a hapax legomenon (appears only once in Scripture, in this verse). Meaning is uncertain - traditionally translated 'heart' or 'mind', but some scholars suggest it may refer to a celestial or meteorological phenomenon." {llm-cs45}
  - note: "H2910 (בַּטֻּחוֹת) literally means 'inward parts' or 'hidden recesses', often associated with the kidneys as the seat of wisdom and emotion in Hebrew thought." {llm-cs45}
  - note: "The verse exhibits classic Hebrew poetic parallelism: 'Who put wisdom in X? / Who gave understanding to Y?' - two parallel questions with synonymous structure." {llm-cs45}
