# Experiment: Concordance-Catalog Approach

**Hypothesis:** The most valuable approach to listing original language words is to focus on **identification and cataloging** using Strong's Concordance numbers as the primary organizing principle, making it easy to look up and cross-reference words.

**Philosophy:** Like a library catalog system - each word gets a unique identifier (Strong's number) with basic reference information. Optimized for quick lookup and cross-referencing across verses.

**Target Use Case:** Translators and pastors who want to quickly identify words and do cross-referencing using Strong's numbers.

## Key Differences from Base README

**Primary Focus:** Strong's Concordance numbers as the central organizing element

**Data Emphasis:**
1. Strong's number (highest priority)
2. Original script
3. Transliteration
4. Basic gloss from Strong's
5. Word order in verse

**De-emphasized:** Detailed morphology, semantic domains, extensive grammatical analysis

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Extraction

**Primary Sources (in order of priority):**
- [ ] BibleHub Interlinear - Primary source for Strong's numbers
- [ ] Strong's Concordance - Definitive glosses and definitions
- [ ] Blue Letter Bible - Cross-verification of Strong's assignments

**Secondary Sources:**
- [ ] Bible Gateway Interlinear - Additional verification

**Extraction Process:**
1. Navigate to BibleHub interlinear for the specific verse
2. Extract each word in order with its Strong's number
3. For each Strong's number, look up the standard Strong's gloss
4. Record original script, transliteration, and word position
5. Cross-verify Strong's numbers against Blue Letter Bible

**Critical Rule:** Every word must have a Strong's number. If unavailable, note as "N/A" and explain why.

### Phase 2: Analysis and Synthesis

**Organization:** Words listed in **verse order** (position 1, 2, 3, etc.)

**Minimal Analysis:**
- Note any words where Strong's assignment is ambiguous
- Flag words that appear multiple times in the verse
- Identify proper nouns (names, places)

**Keep It Simple:** This experiment prioritizes cataloging over interpretation. Avoid extensive grammatical or semantic analysis.

### Phase 3: Citation and Verification

**Every Strong's number must be verified:**
- Check BibleHub shows this Strong's for this word
- Verify gloss matches standard Strong's definition
- Cross-check with Blue Letter Bible if any doubt

## Quality Metrics for This Experiment

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% of words have Strong's numbers (or explicitly marked N/A with reason)
- Strong's numbers are accurate (verified against concordance)
- Words in correct verse order (position field)
- Transliterations follow standard conventions
- Glosses match official Strong's definitions

**Optimal Format:**
- Clean, scannable list organized by position
- Strong's number prominently displayed
- Easy to cross-reference with Strong's Concordance
- Minimal extra information (avoid clutter)

**What Makes This Experiment Succeed:**
- Speed: Can a translator quickly scan and find Strong's numbers?
- Accuracy: Are Strong's assignments correct?
- Cross-referencing: Can this be easily used with other Strong's-based tools?
- Completeness: Is every word cataloged?

## Research Guidelines for This Experiment

**Top Priority:** Get Strong's numbers right. Double-check every assignment.

**Workflow:**
1. Open BibleHub interlinear for verse
2. Go through word by word in order
3. Record Strong's number, original, transliteration, gloss
4. Verify each Strong's number
5. Minimize interpretation - stick to cataloging facts

**Avoid:**
- Deep grammatical analysis (wrong experiment for that)
- Extensive semantic discussion (wrong experiment for that)
- Interpretation of meaning (wrong experiment for that)
- Theological commentary (wrong experiment for that)

**Focus:**
- Accurate Strong's assignments
- Clear presentation
- Complete word inventory
- Easy cross-referencing

## Test Verses for This Experiment

We will test on:
1. **John 1:1** (high-context, theologically rich)
2. **Matthew 5:3** (medium-context, well-known)
3. **Job 38:36** (low-context, obscure)

**Experiment Version:** Rev 1
**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Thesis:** Strong's-based cataloging provides the most practical value for word inventory
