# Experiment: Morphological-Grammar Approach

**Hypothesis:** The most valuable approach to listing original language words is to focus on **detailed grammatical and morphological analysis**, providing complete parsing information that enables deep linguistic study.

**Philosophy:** Like a linguistic analysis - each word is fully parsed with grammatical data (case, gender, number, tense, voice, mood, person). Optimized for scholarly exegesis and detailed grammatical study.

**Target Use Case:** Seminary students, scholars, and advanced translators who need complete morphological data for linguistic analysis.

## Key Differences from Base README

**Primary Focus:** Comprehensive morphological parsing and grammatical analysis

**Data Emphasis:**
1. Root/lexical form (lemma)
2. Inflected form as it appears in text
3. Complete parsing (case, gender, number, tense, voice, mood, person, etc.)
4. Grammatical function in sentence
5. Syntactical relationships

**De-emphasized:** Strong's numbers (included but secondary), basic glosses

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Extraction

**Primary Sources (in order of priority):**
- [ ] Perseus Digital Library - Comprehensive Greek morphological data
- [ ] BibleHub Interlinear - Parsing information
- [ ] Blue Letter Bible - Morphology tools
- [ ] Ancient Hebrew Research Center - Hebrew morphology

**Secondary Sources:**
- [ ] Accordance Bible Software morphology (if accessible)
- [ ] Logos morphological databases (if accessible)

**Extraction Process:**
1. Extract complete original text with word boundaries
2. For each word, extract:
   - Lemma (lexical/dictionary form)
   - Inflected form (as appears in text)
   - Complete morphological parsing
   - Part of speech
   - Syntactical function
3. Verify parsing across multiple sources
4. Note any parsing ambiguities

**For Greek Verbs Extract:**
- Tense (present, aorist, perfect, etc.)
- Voice (active, middle, passive)
- Mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative, infinitive, participle)
- Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Number (singular, plural)

**For Greek Nouns/Adjectives Extract:**
- Case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative)
- Gender (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- Number (singular, plural)

**For Hebrew Extract:**
- Stem (Qal, Niphal, Piel, Hiphil, etc.)
- Tense/Aspect (Perfect, Imperfect, Imperative, etc.)
- Person, Gender, Number
- Pronominal suffixes if present

### Phase 2: Analysis and Synthesis

**Organization:** Words organized by **grammatical function** or **syntactical units**

**Grammatical Analysis:**
- Identify the main verb and its parsing significance
- Note case relationships (e.g., genitive modifying which noun)
- Identify prepositional phrases and their objects
- Note participial phrases and their subjects
- Identify syntactical units (subject, predicate, modifiers)

**Synthesis Focus:**
- How does morphology affect meaning?
- What does the tense/aspect indicate?
- How do case relationships clarify meaning?
- What syntactical structure is present?

### Phase 3: Citation and Verification

**Every parsing detail must be verified:**
- Cross-check parsing across multiple sources
- Verify case assignments
- Confirm verb parsing (especially tense/voice/mood)
- Note when sources disagree on parsing

2. For each word, look up full morphological parsing
3. Cross-verify parsing across Perseus, BibleHub, Blue Letter Bible
4. Note any parsing disagreements between sources
5. Analyze how morphology affects meaning
6. Identify syntactical structure

**Focus:**
- Comprehensive morphological data
- Accurate parsing
- Grammatical insights
- Syntactical relationships
- How morphology affects interpretation

**Avoid:**
- Incomplete parsing (must be thorough)
- Unverified parsing data
- Ignoring syntactical function
- Superficial grammatical analysis
