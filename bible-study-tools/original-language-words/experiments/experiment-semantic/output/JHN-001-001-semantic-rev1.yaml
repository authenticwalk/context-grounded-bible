      why_this_sense: "The temporal sense is activated by ἀρχῇ (beginning), but this is not merely chronological time - it indicates the metaphysical sphere of absolute origin. The preposition establishes the setting for the existence of the Logos before time itself." {llm-cs45}

      contextual_meaning: "the absolute beginning, primordial origin before creation" {llm-cs45}
      why_this_sense: "This echoes Genesis 1:1 (LXX: ἐν ἀρχῇ) but John elevates it beyond the beginning of creation to absolute precedence before time. The dative case (ἀρχῇ) with ἐν creates a locative of sphere - not when the Word began, but the sphere in which He already existed.

      why_this_sense: "The imperfect tense (ἦν) is crucial - it indicates continuous, ongoing existence in the past without reference to a beginning point.

      why_this_sense: "John uses λόγος as a title (with article) for Christ, not merely as 'a word' or 'speech.' This draws on both Jewish (דָּבָר - God's creative word in Gen 1; Psalm 33:6) and Greek philosophical backgrounds (Stoic Logos as divine reason). However, John radically personalizes it - the Logos is not an abstract principle but a person in eternal relationship with God who became incarnate (v. 14). The threefold repetition in v. 1 emphasizes the centrality of the Logos to creation, relationship with God, and divine identity." {llm-cs45}

semantic_structure:
  - theme: "Temporal Priority and Eternal Pre-existence" {llm-cs45}
    words_involved: [1, 2, 3] {llm-cs45}
    significance: "The opening phrase ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν establishes absolute temporal priority - the Word's existence precedes creation and time itself. The imperfect tense ἦν contrasts with γίνομαι (become) used for creation, emphasizing uncreated, continuous existence. This echoes Genesis 1:1 but transcends it - not just present at creation's beginning, but existing before the beginning." {llm-cs45}

  - theme: "Relational Distinction within Unity" {llm-cs45}
    words_involved: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] {llm-cs45}
    significance: "The phrase πρὸς τὸν θεόν establishes both distinction and relationship. The Word and God (Father) are distinct persons (not modalism), yet in eternal, intimate, face-to-face communion. The preposition πρός (rather than μετά or σύν) emphasizes dynamic, oriented relationship. The presence of the article (τὸν θεόν) contrasts with its absence in clause 3, setting up the distinction between person (Father) and nature (deity)." {llm-cs45}

  - theme: "Ontological Divine Identity" {llm-cs45}
    words_involved: [14, 15, 16, 17] {llm-cs45}
    significance: "The climactic clause θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος affirms the Word's full divine nature. The anarthrous predicate θεός is qualitative - the Word possesses the complete nature and essence of deity. This is not 'a god' (polytheism) or 'the God' (collapsing distinction with Father), but deity by nature. The word order emphasizes the predicate - WHAT the Word is receives focus." {llm-cs45}

  - theme: "Communication as Divine Self-Revelation" {llm-cs45}
    words_involved: [5, 8, 17] {llm-cs45}
    significance: "The threefold repetition of λόγος as title emphasizes its centrality. Drawing on both Jewish (God's creative דָּבָר) and Greek (philosophical Logos) backgrounds, John radically personalizes the concept - the Word is not abstract communication or reason, but a divine person who is God's ultimate self-expression. The Word is both God's communication TO humanity and the very nature OF God." {llm-cs45}

semantic_relationships:
  - relationship_type: "parallel" {llm-cs45}
    word_1: "Position 1-2: ἐν ἀρχῇ" {llm-cs45}
    word_2: "Genesis 1:1 LXX: ἐν ἀρχῇ" {llm-cs45}
    explanation: "Direct verbal parallel with Genesis 1:1 (Septuagint) creates intertextual echo. Both begin with creation context, but John's usage transcends it - Genesis describes when creation began; John describes the Word's pre-existence before that beginning. The parallel invites readers to see the Word as the agent of Genesis creation (confirmed in v. 3)." {llm-cs45}

  - relationship_type: "contrast" {llm-cs45}
    word_1: "Position 3, 9, 15: ἦν (imperfect)" {llm-cs45}
    word_2: "John 1:3: ἐγένετο (aorist 'came into being')" {llm-cs45}
    explanation: "The threefold imperfect ἦν (was existing continuously) contrasts with aorist ἐγένετο (came into being) used for creation in v. 3. This grammatical distinction is theologically loaded - the Word eternally existed without origin, while all created things came into existence at a point in time. The repetition emphasizes the Word's uncreated nature." {llm-cs45}

  - relationship_type: "article_presence_contrast" {llm-cs45}
    word_1: "Position 11-12: τὸν θεόν (with article)" {llm-cs45}
    word_2: "Position 14: θεὸς (without article)" {llm-cs45}
    explanation: "Presence of article with θεόν (clause 2) vs. absence with θεός (clause 3) creates crucial distinction. Τὸν θεόν identifies the Father as distinct person; anarthrous θεός describes the Word's divine nature/essence. This grammatical feature solves the apparent paradox - the Word is both with God (distinct person) and is God (shares divine nature). Not two Gods (polytheism) nor same person (modalism), but two persons sharing one divine essence." {llm-cs45}

  - relationship_type: "progression" {llm-cs45}
    word_1: "Clause 1: Temporal setting" {llm-cs45}
    word_2: "Clause 3: Ontological identity" {llm-cs45}
    explanation: "The three clauses connected by καί create theological progression, not mere addition. Movement from WHERE (in the beginning) to WITH WHOM (with God) to WHAT (was God). Each clause builds on the previous: (1) eternal pre-existence, (2) relational distinction, (3) essential deity. The structure prevents misunderstanding - establishing both unity and distinction before affirming divinity." {llm-cs45}

  - relationship_type: "semantic_field_overlap" {llm-cs45}
    word_1: "Position 5: λόγος (Communication domain)" {llm-cs45}
    word_2: "Position 12, 14: θεός (Supernatural Beings domain)" {llm-cs45}
    explanation: "λόγος brings Communication semantic domain while θεός brings Supernatural Being domain. The intersection is profound - the Word is the means by which the infinite, transcendent God communicates Himself to creation. This bridges the gap between an unknowable deity and revealed truth. The Word is both divine (θεός) and revelatory (λόγος) - God's self-communication in person." {llm-cs45}

# === CONTEXTUAL INSIGHTS ===
contextual_notes:
  - word: "λόγος" {llm-cs45}
    observation: "The choice of λόγος as christological title is strategic and multivalent. For Jewish readers, it echoes God's creative word (Genesis 1:3 'God said'), the Word of the Lord to prophets, and wisdom personified (Proverbs 8). For Greek readers, it resonates with Stoic philosophy (Logos as divine reason ordering cosmos) and Philo's intermediary Logos. John transcends both backgrounds by personalizing and incarnating the Logos (v. 14) - making abstract concept into concrete person." {llm-cs45}
    cross_references: ["Genesis 1:3", "Psalm 33:6", "Proverbs 8:22-31", "John 1:14"] {llm-cs45}

  - word: "ἦν (imperfect tense)" {llm-cs45}
    observation: "The threefold repetition of imperfect ἦν is theologically intentional. Imperfect tense in Greek indicates continuous or repeated action in past time without specifying beginning or end. This grammatical choice undermines Arian theology (which claims the Son had a beginning) and affirms eternal, uncreated existence. The contrast with aorist ἐγένετο (came into being) in v. 3 for creation makes this distinction unmistakable." {llm-cs45}
    cross_references: ["John 1:3", "John 8:58", "Colossians 1:17", "Hebrews 13:8"] {llm-cs45}

  - word: "πρός with accusative" {llm-cs45}
    observation: "The preposition choice πρὸς τὸν θεόν (rather than μετά or σύν or παρά) is exegetically significant. Πρός with accusative suggests motion toward, orientation to, or face-to-face position. Early church fathers saw Trinitarian implications - the Word eternally 'facing' the Father in communion, suggesting both distinction of persons and intimacy of relationship. This counters modalism (Father and Son are same person) and subordinationism (Son is lesser being), pointing toward orthodox Trinitarianism." {llm-cs45}
    cross_references: ["John 17:5", "John 17:24", "1 John 1:2"] {llm-cs45}

  - word: "θεός without article (anarthrous)" {llm-cs45}
    observation: "The absence of article before θεός in the predicate position (θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος) has generated enormous theological discussion. Jehovah's Witnesses translate 'the Word was a god' (indefinite), suggesting lesser deity. However, Colwell's Rule and Greek grammar demonstrate this is qualitative - 'the Word was deity in nature' or 'possessed divine essence.' The word order (predicate before verb) emphasizes WHAT the Word was. Had John written ὁ θεός ἦν ὁ λόγος, it would suggest Father and Word are identical person (modalism). Had he written ὁ λόγος ἦν θεός τις, it would suggest a lesser god (polytheism). The actual construction affirms full divinity while maintaining personal distinction from the Father." {llm-cs45}
    cross_references: ["John 20:28", "Titus 2:13", "2 Peter 1:1", "1 John 5:20"] {llm-cs45}

  - word: "ἀρχή (beginning)" {llm-cs45}
    observation: "The temporal semantic of ἀρχή connects with Genesis 1:1 (בְּרֵאשִׁית / ἐν ἀρχῇ in LXX), but John elevates the meaning. While Genesis marks the beginning of creation, John points to what existed BEFORE that beginning. The Word didn't come into being at creation's start but already existed 'in the beginning' - implying pre-temporal, eternal existence. This reading is confirmed by 'all things came into being through him' (v. 3) - the Word cannot be part of 'all things' that came into being." {llm-cs45}
