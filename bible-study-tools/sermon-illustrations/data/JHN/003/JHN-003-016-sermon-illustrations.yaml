        - "Which testimony or story would you share with someone who doesn't know Jesus?" # {llm-cs45}

# === KEY INSIGHTS ===
key_insights:
  - insight: "Parent-child sacrifice pattern creates strongest emotional resonance" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "Illustrations involving parent-child relationships (Mufasa→Simba, Yondu→Peter, even God→Jesus) tap into deep human instincts about parental love. This makes John 3:16's 'gave his one and only Son' viscerally understood." # {llm-cs45}

  - insight: "Substitutionary sacrifice requires concrete examples to grasp" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "Abstract atonement theology becomes real through specific stories (Kolbe for Gajowniczek, Carton for Darnay, Aslan for Edmund). These illustrations make 'one dying for another' concrete rather than theoretical." # {llm-cs45}

  - insight: "Diverse conversion testimonies prove 'whoever believes'" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "Showing conversions across different backgrounds (religious persecutor, politician, addict, rock star) demonstrates that John 3:16's promise is truly universal. No one is too far gone." # {llm-cs45}

  - insight: "WebFetch access enables preacher-sourced illustrations" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "With working WebFetch permissions, this tool can now access PreachingToday.com and similar resources, validating the hybrid approach combining cultural artifacts with actual sermon content." # {llm-cs45}

  - concern: "Multiple sacrifice illustrations could become redundant" # {llm-cs45}
    guidance: "Choose 2-3 illustrations maximum per sermon. Select based on audience demographics and sermon structure. Don't try to use everything." # {llm-cs45}
