  # What CAN be said from search results:
  observed_from_search_results: |
    Most preachers appear to focus on Habakkuk 3:17-19 as the climactic
    conclusion of the chapter rather than verse 9 specifically. Verse 9
    is typically included as part of the theophany description (vv. 3-15)
    showing God's power and past acts of deliverance. The word "Selah"
    appears in verse 9, indicating this was meant to be sung with a
    triumphal tone.
  # {llm-cs45 based on search metadata only}

# === EXEGETICAL INSIGHTS (from accessible commentaries) ===
exegetical_insights:
  verse_meaning:
    warrior_imagery: "The bow represents God as divine warrior. 'Uncovered' or 'stripped the sheath' indicates God removing His bow from its protective case, preparing for battle" # {source: multiple commentaries via search}
    covenant_connection: "The KJV phrase 'according to the oaths of the tribes' connects this to God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Israelites" # {source: commentary via search}
    judgment_symbolism: "The bow represents the threat of God's vengeance - the longer delayed, the more severe the eventual judgment" # {source: commentary via search}
    nature_imagery: "'Split the earth with rivers' may refer to torrential downpours causing streams to swell to river-like proportions, part of the storm theophany" # {source: commentary via search}

  literary_context:
    structure: "Part of Habakkuk's prayer/song (3:1-19), specifically within the theophany description (vv. 3-15)"
    selah_marker: "Verse 9 includes 'Selah' (also in vv. 3, 13), indicating pause for musical/liturgical reflection"
    historical_reference: "Recalls God's past acts of deliverance, particularly the Exodus and conquest of Canaan"

# === KEY INSIGHTS ===
key_insights:
  - insight: "METHODOLOGICAL INSIGHT: This experiment faces a critical infrastructure challenge - automated access to sermon transcripts is blocked by nearly all major sermon websites (403 errors)" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "The experiment design requires extracting REAL sermon data, but modern web security prevents automated extraction. Manual access or API partnerships would be required for this methodology to succeed." # {llm-cs45}

  - insight: "HOMILETICAL INSIGHT: Habakkuk 3:9 appears to be rarely preached as a standalone text. Most sermons focus on 3:17-19 or treat chapter 3 as a whole." # {llm-cs45 based on search patterns}
    rationale: "Verse 9 is rich in imagery but functions as part of a longer poetic description. Its value may be more in scholarly study than in standalone sermon application, which explains why preachers typically include it within broader chapter expositions." # {llm-cs45}

  - insight: "TEXTUAL INSIGHT: The verse contains powerful warrior imagery that connects God's present action to His covenant faithfulness and past deliverance" # {source: commentary analysis}
    rationale: "This imagery would be valuable for sermons on God's sovereignty, His faithfulness to promises, or His active intervention on behalf of His people. The connection to covenant oaths provides theological depth beyond the vivid imagery." # {llm-cs45}

    - site: "enduringword.com, bibleref.com, etc."
      error: "403 Forbidden"
      attempted_resources: "Commentary and exposition resources"

  search_limitations:
    - "YouTube-specific searches did not return direct video IDs or transcript links"
    - "SermonAudio PDF resources blocked despite being listed as public"
    - "Most search results provided metadata but not actual transcript content"
    - "Site-specific searches (site:youtube.com) returned no results"

  methodology_gaps:
    - "Experiment design assumes automated access to public sermon resources"
    - "No provision for API access or authenticated data retrieval"
    - "Web scraping protections on most sermon sites prevent automated extraction"
    - "YouTube transcript extraction would require authenticated API access"

# === RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ITERATIONS ===
recommendations:
  technical:
    - "Establish API partnerships with sermon websites (SermonAudio, YouTube, Desiring God, etc.)"
    - "Develop authenticated access methods rather than web scraping"
    - "Consider manual curation of sermon sources with copy-paste extraction"
    - "Build relationships with churches/ministries for direct transcript access"

  methodological:
    - "For obscure verses, acknowledge when sermon data is scarce rather than forcing extraction"
    - "Consider focusing on popular preaching texts where sermon data is more abundant"
    - "Supplement sermon extraction with published sermon illustration books (which may have better access)"
    - "Use commentary and exegetical resources as backup when transcripts unavailable"

  scope:
    - "This experiment may work better for well-known texts (Lord's Prayer, Psalm 23, John 3:16) where sermon content is abundant and sometimes published in books/articles"
    - "Minor prophets like Habakkuk may require different research approaches"
    - "Consider a hybrid model: sermon extraction for popular texts, exegetical analysis for obscure verses"
