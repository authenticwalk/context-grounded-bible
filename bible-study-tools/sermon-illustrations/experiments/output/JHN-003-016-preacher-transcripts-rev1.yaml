# === CRITICAL LIMITATION ===
experiment_challenges:
  primary_issue: "Unable to access sermon transcripts due to 403 access restrictions"
  technical_details: |
    Attempted to extract actual sermon transcripts from multiple sources but encountered
    403 Forbidden errors on all major sermon websites including:
    - SermonCentral.com
    - DesiringGod.org (John Piper sermons)
    - TheGospelCoalition.org (D.A. Carson sermons)
    - Archive.org sermon collections
    - PreachingToday.com
    - SermonAudio.com
    - Individual church websites

    This prevented extraction of actual sermon transcripts with verifiable timestamps,
    which is the core requirement of this experiment.

  data_quality_impact: |
    HIGH IMPACT - The experiment requires ACTUAL sermon transcripts with timestamps.
    Without access to transcripts, this output contains only:
    1. Sermon sources identified through web search (but not accessed)
    2. Illustration summaries from secondary sources (not primary transcripts)
    3. No verifiable timestamps or direct quotes from actual sermons

    This output does NOT meet the experiment's quality standards and should be
    considered a FAILED attempt that documents the access limitations encountered.

  methodology_compliance: |
    Per README guidance: "If you cannot find sermon transcripts for a verse, document
    that challenge rather than fabricating content."

    This file documents the challenge. No sermon content was fabricated.

      A young orphaned boy selling papers on a cold Christmas Eve was told by a
      policeman to go to a mission and say "John 3, verse 16" as the password to
      get inside. After being warmed by a fireplace, the boy said, "I don't know

      [SUMMARY FROM SEARCH RESULTS - NOT ACTUAL TRANSCRIPT]
      In 2009, college quarterback Tim Tebow wrote "John 3:16" on his eye black
      during the BCS National Championship Game. Three years later in an NFL playoff
      game (January 8, 2012), Tebow passed for 316 yards with an average of 31.6
      yards per completion, and the game's TV rating was 31.6. During and after
      the game, "John 3:16" became the most searched term on Google, with over
      90 million searches. This "coincidence" drew massive attention to the verse.

      [SUMMARY FROM SEARCH RESULTS - NOT ACTUAL TRANSCRIPT]
      A young English preacher named Henry Moorehouse came to Chicago to preach
      at D.L. Moody's church. Moorehouse preached seven consecutive sermons on
      John 3:16, emphasizing "that God loves them" each night. This approach
      initially surprised D.L. Moody but transformed his understanding of God's
      love and his preaching ministry.

# === CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS ===
# Based on limited secondary sources only

    sermons_using:
      - "John Piper (referenced '4 D's' including God's design of love)"
      - "D.A. Carson (sermon titled 'The God Who Loves')"
      - "Paul Tripp (titled 'Divine Generosity')"
    variations: "Cannot determine variations without actual transcripts - would need to see how each preacher uniquely frames God's love" # {sermon-identified-not-accessed}

# === UNIQUE APPROACHES ===
# Cannot determine without actual sermon transcripts

  - preacher: "Cannot determine"
    approach: "Without access to actual sermon transcripts, cannot identify unique approaches or particularly effective methods"
    why_notable: "This would require comparative analysis of actual sermon content" # {sermon-identified-not-accessed}

# === USAGE GUIDANCE ===
# Severely limited without actual sermon transcripts
usage_guidance:
  most_common_structure: "Cannot determine without access to actual sermon transcripts and timestamps" # {sermon-identified-not-accessed}
  illustration_placement: "Cannot determine without access to actual sermon transcripts and timestamps" # {sermon-identified-not-accessed}
  pastoral_framing: "Based on sermon titles only, preachers appear to frame John 3:16 around themes of God's love, divine generosity, and the necessity of belief, but specific framing cannot be determined without transcripts" # {llm-cs45 based on search-summary}

# === KEY INSIGHTS ===
key_insights:
  - insight: "John 3:16 is one of the most preached verses in Scripture with abundant sermon content available" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "Web searches revealed dozens of sermons by prominent preachers, suggesting this verse is central to Christian preaching"
    limitation: "However, this abundance of content is inaccessible due to technical barriers (403 errors), preventing the core experiment objective"

  - insight: "The experiment design requires direct access to sermon transcripts, which is technically challenging" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "Major sermon websites implement access restrictions that prevent automated transcript extraction"
    implication: "This experiment may need an alternative methodology such as: (1) manual transcript procurement with permission, (2) focus on open-access platforms, (3) partnership with sermon archives, or (4) using sermon books/published transcripts"

  - insight: "Even without transcript access, evidence suggests John 3:16 sermons use diverse illustration types" # {llm-cs45 based on search-summary}
    rationale: "Search results reference historical stories (D.L. Moody), contemporary events (Tim Tebow), personal testimonies, and theological quotes (Luther)"
    limitation: "Cannot verify how preachers actually used these illustrations without seeing actual transcripts"

  - insight: "The verse's familiarity creates both opportunities and challenges for preachers" # {llm-cs45}
    rationale: "Multiple search results referenced how John 3:16 is 'the most famous verse' - preachers must find fresh angles on familiar content"
    limitation: "Cannot analyze how specific preachers addressed this challenge without transcript access"

# === EXPERIMENT EVALUATION ===
experiment_evaluation:
  success_level: "FAILED"
  success_criteria_met:
    - "5-10 actual sermon sources identified and extracted": false
    - "At least 3-5 concrete illustrations extracted from transcripts": false
    - "All illustrations traceable to specific timestamps in actual sermons": false
    - "Evidence of diverse preaching styles and contexts": false
    - "Clear demonstration of how preachers used each illustration": false

  key_validation_failures:
    - "Cannot provide working URLs with accessible transcripts"
    - "Cannot provide timestamps for verification"
    - "Cannot provide direct quotes from actual sermons"
    - "Cannot verify illustration usage in context"

  lessons_learned: |
    This experiment requires either:
    1. Manual transcript procurement (purchasing, requesting permission, or personal attendance)
    2. Focus on genuinely open-access platforms (public domain sermons, Creative Commons content)
    3. Partnership agreements with sermon archives
    4. YouTube transcripts via direct API access (not web scraping)
    5. Published sermon books as alternative to online transcripts

    The current approach of web-based automated extraction is not viable due to
    widespread 403 access restrictions across sermon websites.

  recommendation: |
    For future iterations:
    - Consider focusing on YouTube sermons where transcript API might be available
    - Focus on public domain historical sermons (19th century evangelists)
    - Partner with churches that explicitly make transcripts available
    - Use published sermon collections (books) as sources
    - Consider podcasts with show notes that include detailed content summaries

    OR: Pivot experiment to focus on sermon illustration DATABASES (like
    SermonCentral's illustration section) which are designed for sharing and may
    have different access policies than full sermon transcripts.
