  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'ὁ,

  ἡ, τό, is, when thus written,

  __A demonstrative Pronoun.

  __B  in Attic dialect, definite or prepositive Article.

  __C  in Epic dialect, the so-called postpositive Article, = relative Pronoun, ὅς,
  ἥ, ὅ.—The nominative masculine and feminine singular and plural, ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ, have
  no accent in codices and most printed books, except when used as the relative; but
  ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ differ only in writing from ὃ, ἣ, οἳ, α; the nominative forms of the
  article are said by Hdn.Gr.1.474 to be oxytone, and by [Refs 2nd c.AD+] in Aeolic
  dialect accusative to [Refs 8th c.BC+] genitive and dative dual τοῖιν [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]— In Doric dialect and all other dialects except Attic dialect and Ionic dialect
  the feminine forms preserve the old ᾱ instead of changing it to η, hence Doric dialect
  etc. ἁ, τάν, τᾶ; the genitive plural τάων contracts in many dialects to τᾶ; the
  genitive singular is in many places τῶ, accusative plural τώς, but Cretan dialect,
  etc., τόνς [Refs]; in Lesbian Aeolic dialect the accusative plural forms are τοὶς,
  ταὶς, [Refs]; dative plural τοῖς, ταῖς (or τοὶς, ταὶς, see above), [Refs]; ταῖσι
  as demonstrative, [Refs 7th c.BC+] Poets also used the Ionic dialect and _Epic dialect_
  forms τοῖσι, ταῖσ; and in Trag. we find τοὶ μέν.., τοὶ δέ.., for οἱ μέν.., οἱ δέ..,
  not only in Lyric poetry, as [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but even in a trimeter, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+] {ὅ}; τὼ πόλεε Foed. cited in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in [Refs 4th c.AD+] functions
  as genitive dual feminine, μεσακόθεν τοῖς κράναιυν [Refs 4th c.BC+] —in Elean and
  _Boeotian dialect_ ὁ, ἡ (ἁ), τό, with the addition of -ί, ={ὅδε}, ἥδε, τόδε, _nominative_
  _plural_ _masculine_ τυΐ the following men, [Refs 3rd c.BC+] cf. Sanskrit demonstrative
  pronoun sa, sā, Gothic sa, sō, ONorse sá, sú, Old Latin accusative sum, sam (Enn.):
  —with τό [from *τόδ] cf. Sanskrit tat (tad), Latin is-tud, Gothic pata: —with τοί
  cf. Sanskrit te, Lithuanian tĩe, O[Refs 5th c.BC+] pá, etc.:—with τάων cf. Sanskrit
  tāsām, Latin is-tarum:— the origin of the relative ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (which see) is different.)

  __A ὁ, ἡ, τό, DEMONSTR. PRONOUN, that, the oldest and in [Refs 8th c.BC+] the commonest
  sense: frequently also in [Refs 5th c.BC+], and sometimes in Trag. (mostly in Lyric
  poetry, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; τῶν γάρ.., τῆς γάρ.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; seldom in Attic
  dialect Prose, except in special phrases, see infr. VI, VII):

  __A.I joined with a substantive, to call attention to it, ὁ Τυδεΐδης he—Tydeus''
  famous son, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τὸν Χρύσην that venerable man Chryses, I.II: and so
  with appellative, Νέστωρ ὁ γέρων N.—thataged man, [Refs]; αἰετοῦ.. τοῦ θηρητῆρος
  the eagle, that which is called hunter, [Refs]; also to define and give emphasis,
  τιμῆς τῆς Πριάμου for honour, namely that of Priam, [Refs]; οἴχετ᾽ ἀνὴρ ὤριστος
  a man is gone, and he the best, [Refs]:—different from this are cases [Refs 8th
  c.BC+] if he would help the Trojans, but drive those back to the ships—I mean the
  Achaeans, where Ἀχ. is only added to explain τούς, compare [Refs]

  __A.II frequently without a substantive, he, she, it, ὁ γὰρ ἦλθε [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.III placed after its Noun, before the Relat. Prons., ἐφάμην σὲ περὶ φρένας ἔμμεναι
  ἄλλων, τῶν ὅσσοι Λυκίην ναιετάουσι far above the rest, above those to wit who, etc.,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οἷ᾽ οὔ πώ τιν᾽ ἀκούομεν οὐδὲ παλαιῶν, τάων αἳ πάρος ἦσαν.. Ἀχαιαί
  such as we have not heard tell of yet even among the women of old, those women to
  wit who.., [Refs 8th c.BC+] —for the _Attic dialect_ usage see below

  __A.IV before a Possessive pronoun its demonstrative force is sometimes very manifest,
  φθίσει σε τὸ σὸν μένος that spirit of thine, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.V for cases in which the Homeric usage approaches most nearly to the Attic,
  see below [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VI ὁ μέν.., ὁ δέ.. without a substantive, in all cases, genders, and numbers,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+] properly refers to the former, ὁ δέ to the latter; more rarely
  ὁ μέν the latter, ὁ δέ the former, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: sometimes in Partition, the
  one.., the other.., etc.—The Noun with it is regularly in genitive plural, being
  divided by the ὁ μέν.., ὁ δέ.., into parts, ἠΐθεοι καὶ παρθένοι.., τῶν δ᾽ αἱ μὲν
  λεπτὰς ὀθόνας ἔχον, οἱ δὲ χιτῶνας εἵατο [Refs 8th c.BC+]: but frequently the Noun
  is in the same case, by a kind of apposition, ἴδον υἷε Δάρητος, τὸν μὲν ἀλευάμενον
  τὸν δὲ κτάμενον [Refs 8th c.BC+]: so in Trag. and Attic dialect, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  if the Noun be collective, it is in the genitive singular, ὁ μὲν πεπραμένος ἦν τοῦ
  σίτου, ὁ δὲ ἔνδον ἀποκείμενος [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VI.2 when a negative accompanies ὁ δέ, it follows δέ, e.g. τὰς γοῦν Ἀθήνας οἶδα
  τὸν δὲ χῶρον οὔ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VI.3 ὁ μέν τις.., ὁ δέ τις.. is used in Prose, when the Noun to which ὁ refers
  is left indefinite, ἔλεγον ὁ μέν τις τὴν σοφίαν, ὁ δὲ τὴν καρτερίαν.., ὁ δέ τις
  καὶ τὸ κάλλος [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VI.4 on τὸ μέν.., τὸ δέ.., or τὰ μέν.., τὰ δέ.., [Refs]

  __A.VI.5 ὁ μέν is frequently used without a corresponding ὁ δέ, οἱ μὲν ἄρ᾽ ἐσκίδναντο..,
  Μυρμιδόνας δ᾽ οὐκ εἴα ἀποσκίδνασθαι [Refs 8th c.BC+]; by ἄλλος δέ, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VI.6 ὁ δέ following μέν sometimes refers to the subject of the preceding clause,
  τοῦ μὲν ἅμαρθ᾽, ὁ δὲ Λεῦκον.. βεβλήκει [Refs 8th c.BC+]: rare in Attic dialect Prose,
  ἐπεψήφιζεν αὐτὸς ἔφορος ὤν· ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἔφη διαγιγνώσκειν τὴν βοήν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VI.7 ὁ δέ is frequently used simply in continuing a narrative, [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  also used by [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VI.8 the opposition may be expressed otherwise than by μέν and δέ, οὔθ᾽ ὁ..
  οὔθ᾽ ὁ [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VII the following usages prevailed in Attic dialect Prose,

  __A.VII.1 in dialogue, after καί, it was usual to say in nominative singular masculine
  καὶ ὅ; in the other cases the usual forms of the Article were used (see. ὅς [Refs
  4th c.BC+] II.I and cf. Sanskrit sas, alternatative form of sa); so, in accusative,
  καὶ τὸν εἰπεῖν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VII.2 ὁ καὶ ὁ such and such, τῇ καὶ τῇ ἀτιμίᾳ [Refs 5th c.BC+]: but mostly in
  accusative, καί μοι κάλει τὸν καὶ τόν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἀνάγκη ἄρα τὸ καὶ τό it
  must then be so and so, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; but τὰ καὶ τά now one thing, now another,
  of good and bad, τὸν δ᾽ ἀγαθὸν τολμᾶν χρὴ τά τε καὶ τὰ φέρειν [Refs 6th c.BC+];
  so πάντα τοῦ μετρίου μεταβαλλόμενα ἐπὶ τὰ καὶ ἐπὶ τά, of excess and defect, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII absolutely usages of single cases,

  __A.VIII.1 feminine dative τῇ, of Place, there, on that spot, here, this way, that
  way, [Refs 8th c.BC+], etc.: also in Prose, τὸ μὲν τῇ, τὸ δὲ τῇ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.1.b with a notion of motion towards, that way, in that direction, [Refs
  8th c.BC+] —only poetry

  __A.VIII.1.c of Manner, τῇ περ τελευτήσεσθαι ἔμελλεν in this way, thus, [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.1.d repeated, τῇ μέν.., τῇ δέ.., in one way.., in another.., or partly..,
  partly.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.1.e relative, where, by which way, only Epic dialect, as [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.2 neuter dative τῷ, therefore, on this account, frequently in [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.2.b thus, so, [Refs 8th c.BC+] precedes, be translated, then, if this be
  so, on this condition, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.3 neuter accusative τό, wherefore, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; also τὸ δέ absolutely,
  but the fact is.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; even when the τό refers to what precedes, the
  contrast may lie not in the thing referred to, but in another part of the sentence
  (compare above[Refs 5th c.BC+]; φασὶ δέ τινες αὐτὸν καὶ τῶν ἑπτὰ σοφῶν γεγονέναι·
  τὸ δὲ οὐκ ἦν but he was not, [Refs 1st c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.4 τὸ μέν.., τὸ δέ.., partly.., partly.., or on the one hand.., on the other..,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; more frequently τὰ μέν.., τὰ δέ.., [Refs 5th c.BC+] in the first
  clause, τὸ δέ τι [Refs] several times..  and finally, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.5 of Time, sometimes that time, sometimes this (present) time, συνμαχία
  κ᾽ ἔα ἑκατὸν ϝέτεα, ἄρχοι δέ κα τοΐ (where it is possible, but not necessary, to
  supply ϝέτος) [Refs 6th c.BC+] from that time, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.5.b πρὸ τοῦ, sometimes written προτοῦ, before this, aforetime, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.5.c in Thess. Prose, ὑππρὸ τᾶς yesterday, τὰ ψαφίσματα τό τε ὑππρὸ τᾶς
  γενόμενον καὶ τὸ τᾶμον the decree which was passed yesterday (literal before this
  [day]), and to-day''s, [Refs 3rd c.BC+]

  __A.VIII.6 ἐν τοῖς is frequently used in Prose with Superlatives, ἐν τοῖσι θειότατον
  a most marvellous thing, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἐν τοῖς πρῶτοι the very first, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; ἐν τοῖσι πρῶτος (πρώτοις codices) [Refs 5th c.BC+]; [Ζεὺς] Ἔρωτά τε
  καὶ Ἀνάγκην ἐν τοῖς πρῶτα ἐγέννησεν first of all, [Refs 2nd c.AD+] the greatest
  number of ships, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: also with adverbs, ἐν τοῖς μάλιστα [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]: in late Prose, also with Positives, ἐν τοῖς παράδοξον [Refs 1st c.BC+]

  __B ὁ, ἡ, τό, THE DEFINITE ARTICLE, the, to specify individuals: rare in this signification
  in the earliest Gr., becoming commoner later. In [Refs 8th c.BC+] the demonstrative
  force can generally be traced, [Refs 4th c.BC+] I, but the definite Article must
  be recognized in places [Refs 8th c.BC+]: also when joined to an adjective to make
  it a substantive, αἰὲν ἀποκτείνων τὸν ὀπίστατον the hindmost man, [Refs 8th c.BC+].;
  also in τῶν ἄλλων [Refs]; also τὸ τρίτον[Refs]; τὸ μὲν ἄλλο for the rest,[Refs]—The
  true Article, however, is first fully established in 5th C Attic dialect, whilst
  the demonstrative usage disappears, except in a few cases, V. [Refs 4th c.BC+] —Chief
  usages, especially in _Attic dialect_

  __B.I not only with common Appellats., adjectives, and Parts., to specify them as
  present to sense or mind, but also frequently where we use the Possessive pronoun,
  τὸ κέαρ ηὐφράνθην [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὴν κεφαλὴν κατεάγην my head was broken, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τοὺς φίλους ποιούμεθα we make our friends, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὰς πόλεις
  ἔκτιζον they began founding their cities, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.b omitted with proper nounsand frequently with Appellats. which require no
  specification, as θεός, βασιλεύς, see at {θεός} [Refs] III; ἐμ πόλει in the Acropolis,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare Θράσυλος in [Refs]; or when the person spoken of is to
  be specially distinguished, Ζεύς, ὅστις ὁ Ζεύς whoever this Zeus is, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  and therefore properly omitted when a special designation follows, as Σωκράτης ὁ
  φιλόσοφος: seldom in Trag. with proper nouns, save to give peculiar emphasis, like
  Latin ille, ὁ Λάϊος, ὁ Φοῖβος, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.c Aristotle says Σωκράτης meaning the historical Socrates, as in [Refs] when
  he means the Platonic Socrates, as [Refs]

  __B.I.d for Σαῦλος ὁ καὶ Παῦλος, etc., see at {καί} [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.2 in a generic sense, where the individual is treated as a type, οἷς ὁ γέρων
  μετέῃσιν.. λεύσσει [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.I.2.b frequently with abstract Nouns, ἥ τε ἐλπὶς καὶ ὁ ἔρως [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.3 of outstanding members of a class, ὁ γεωγράφος, ὁ κωμικός, ὁ ποιητής, ὁ
  τεχνικός, see at {γεωγράφος}, κωμικός, ποιητής, τεχνικός.

  __B.I.4 with infinitives, which thereby become Substantives, τὸ εἴργειν prevention,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ φρονεῖν good sense, [Refs 5th c.BC+]infinitive, τὸ θεοὺς εἶναι
  the existence of gods, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ μηδένα εἶναι ὄλβιον the fact or statement
  that no one is happy, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.5 in neuter before any word or expression which itself is made the object
  of thought, τὸ ἄνθρωπος the word or notion man; τὸ λέγω the word λέγ; τὸ μηδὲν ἄγαν
  the sentiment ''ne quid nimis'', [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ τῇ αὐτῇ the phrase τῇ αὐτῇ,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] the opinion about the question ''who ought to rule'', [Refs]; τὸ
  ἐὰν μένητε παρ᾽ ἐμοί, ἀποδώσω the phrase ''I will give back, if.. '', [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; τὸ ὀλίγοι the term few, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B.I.6 before relative clauses, when the Article serves to combine the whole relative
  clause into one notion, τῇ ᾗ φὴς σὺ σκληρότητι the harshness you speak of, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τὸν ἥμερον καρπόν.., καὶ τὸν ὅσος ξύλινος (i.e. καὶ τὸν καρπὸν ὅσος
  ἂν ᾖ ξύλινος) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.7 before Prons.,

  __B.I.7.a before the person Prons., giving them greater emphasis, but only in accusative,
  τὸν ἐμέ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸν.. σὲ καὶ ἐμέ[Refs]

  __B.I.7.b before the interrogative pronoun (both τίς and ποῖος), referring to something
  before, which needs to be more distinctly specified, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τῆς ποίας
  μερίδο; [Refs 4th c.BC+]; τοῖς ποίοις..; [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B.I.7.c with τοιοῦτος, τοιόσδε, τηλικοῦτος, etc., the Article either makes the
  pronoun into a substantive, ὁ τοιοῦτος that sort of person, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or
  subjoins it to a substantive which already has an Article, τὴν ἀπολογίαν τὴν τοιαύτην
  [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B.I.8 before ἅπας, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also τὸν ἕνα, τὸν ἕνα τοῦτον, [Refs 4th c.BC+]
  see entry; and on οἱ ἄλλοι, οἱ πολλοί, etc., see at {ἄλλος} [Refs]

  __B.I.9 the Article with the comparative is rare, if ἤ follows, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II elliptic expressions:

  __B.II.1 before the genitive of a proper name, to express descent, son or daughter,
  Θουκυδίδης ὁ Ὀλόρου (i.e. υἱός) [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Ἑλένη ἡ τοῦ Διός (i.e. θυγάτηρ)

  Cl. and his men, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὁ τοῦ Ἀντιγένεος the slave of [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  τοῖς ὁρῶσι κόσμος performance of the rites due to the dead befits the living, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τὰ τῶν θεῶν that which is destined by the gods, [Refs 5th c.BC+] what
  regards me or thee, my or thy business or interests, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: and with
  genitive of [Refs 5th c.BC+] is frequently also, a man''s word or saying, as τὸ
  τοῦ Σόλωνος [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ τοῦ Ὁμήρου as Homer says, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also
  τά τινος so-and-so''s house, [NT+5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.3 very frequently with cases governed by Preps.. αἱ ἐκ τῆς Ζακύνθου νῆες

  of time and place, when one cannot (as in the preceding instances) supply a substantive,
  as κἀκεῖσε καὶ τὸ δεῦρο [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὁ μὲν τὸ κεῖθεν, ὁ δὲ τὸ κεῖθεν [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __C as RELATIVE PRONOUN in many dialects; both in nominative singular masculine
  ὅ, as κλῦθί μοι, ὃ χθιζὸς θεὸς ἤλυθες [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὃ ἐξορύξη he who banishes
  him, [Refs]; and in the forms beginning with τ, especially in [Refs 8th c.BC+]:

  __D CRASIS OF ARTICLE:

  __D.a Attic dialect ὁ, ἡ, τό, with ᾰ make ᾱ, as ἁνήρ, ἁλήθεια, τἀγαθόν, τᾄτιο; so
  οἱ, αἱ, τά, as ἅνδρες, τἀγαθ; also τοῦ, τῷ, as τἀγαθοῦ, τἀγαθῷ: ὁ, τό, οἱ, before
  e gives ου, οὑξ, οὑπί, οὑμός, τοὔργον, οὑπιχώριοι, etc.; also τοῦ, as τοὐμοῦ, τοὐπιόντο;
  but ἅτερος, θάτερον ([musical notation]), Ionic dialect οὕτερος, τοὔτερον (see.
  ἕτερος), Attic dialect feminine ἡτέρα, dative θητέρᾳ (see. ἕτερος); τῷ loses the
  iota, τὠμῷ, τὠπιόντι: ὁ, τό, before ο gives ου, as Οὁδυσσεύς, Οὑλύμπιος, τοὔνομα:
  ὁ, τό, etc., before αυ gives ᾱυ, αὑτός, ταὐτό, ταὐτῷ (frequently written ἁτός, etc.
  in Inscrr. and Papyrus); so τὰ αὐτά=ταὐτά, αἱ αὐταί=αὑταί: ἡ before εὐ gives ηὑ,
  as ηὑλάβεια: τῇ before ἡ gives θη, as θἠμέρᾳ: τὸ before ὑ gives θου, as θοὔδωρ for
