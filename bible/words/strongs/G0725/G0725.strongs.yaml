  __1. prop., accusative, to the rule of its formation (Bl., § 27, 2), actively, the
  act of seizing, robbery (Plut., Deu Puer. Educ., p. 12A), Php.2:6, AV (Waterland,
  Works, II, 108; Cremer, 649 f.; Meyer, in l; cf. also JThS, July, 1909, April, 1911;
  MM, see word).

  __2. Passively = ἅρπαγμα (Eze.22:25, of a lion''s prey, ), a thing seized, hence,
  a prize: Phi, l.with, RV (Lft., Ellic., ICC, in l; Donaldson, NCrat., 450 ff.; and
  esp. Gifford, The Incarnation, 59-71, and reff. in DB, ii, 835 B). The lexical data
  favour the active meaning, but as they also admit the possibility of the alternative,
  most modern expositors have accepted the latter as seeming to suit the logic of
  the passage better. The lexical difficulty, however, remains (MM, see word, esp.
  the last ref.). As to the usage of St. Paul, he seems inclined to adopt the -μα
  form where it is appropriate (e.g. Rom.11:9, where cf. LXX; 1Co.13:9, 2 Co 19),
  and there is certainly a presumption in favour of the active meaning here from the
  fact that he does not use the LXX ἅρπαγμα. Suggestions looking to a fresh exegesis
  are given in JThS, ll with†
