etymology: 'ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε,

  demonstrative pronoun, this, formed by adding the enclitic -δε to the old demonstrative
  pronoun ὁ, ἡ, τό, and declined like it through all cases: Epic dialect dative plural
  τοῖσδεσσι, τοῖσδεσσιν, as well as τοῖσδε, [Refs 8th c.BC+]: Aeolic dialect genitive
  plural τῶνδεων [Refs 7th c.BC+]; ταδή [Refs 5th c.BC+] —ὅδε, like{οὗτος}, is opposed
  to ἐκεῖνος, to designate what is nearer as opposed to to what is more remote; but
  ὅδε refers more distinctly to what is present, to what can be seen or pointed out,
  though this distinction is sometimes not observed, e.g. ξύμπας Ἀχαιῶν λαός, ἐν δὲ
  τοῖσδ᾽ ἐγώ [Refs 5th c.BC+];— τοῦτον, ὅνπερ εἰσορᾷς [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.6 in [Refs 4th c.BC+] designates a particular thing, ''such and such'', τοδὶ
  διὰ τοδὶ αἱρεῖται [Refs]; ἥδε ἡ ἰατρική, opposed to αὐτὴ ἡ ἰ., [Refs]; τόδε τι a

  ten years, [Refs]; τῶνδε τῶν ἀσκητῶν athletes of the present day, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __III.3 as ''antecedent'' to a defining Relat., ὃν πόλις στήσειε, τοῦδε χρὴ κλύειν
  [Refs 8th c.BC+] is separate, as ὃς δέ κε μηρίνθοιο τύχῃ.., ὁ δ᾽ οἴσεται ἡμιπέλεκκα
  [Refs 8th c.BC+] sometimes has its deictic force and the relative clause merely
  explains, as νήσου τῆσδ᾽ ἐφ᾽ ἧς ναίει [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __IV Adverbial usage of some cases:

  __IV.1 τῇδε,
