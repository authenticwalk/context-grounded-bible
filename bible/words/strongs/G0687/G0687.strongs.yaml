etymology: 'ἆρᾰ,

  interrogative Particle, implying anxiety or impatience, = Epic dialect and Lyric
  poetry ἦ ῥα:

  __1 alone, it simply marks the question, the nature of which is determined by the
  context: e.g. in [Refs 4th c.BC+] a negative answer is implied in the question ἆρ᾽
  ἂν οἴεσθε..; but an affirmative in [Refs 5th c.BC+] ἆ. βέβληκα δὶς ἐφεξῆ; compare
  ἆρ᾽ εὐτυχεῖς.. ἢ δυστυχεῖ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; and to make it plainly affirmative,
  ἆρ᾽ ο; ἆρ᾽ οὐχ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἆρ᾽ οὐχ οὕτω; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __2 ἆ. οὖ; is used to draw an affirmative inference, [Refs]; also when a negative
  answer is expected, [Refs]; with a negative, ἆρ᾽ οὖν οὐ..; [Refs]

  __3 in ἆρά γε, each Particle retains its force, γε serving to make the question
  more definite, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __4 less frequently with τίς interrogative, τίνος ποτ᾽ ἆρ᾽ ἔπραξε χειρί[Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; τίδ᾽ ἆρ᾽ ἐγὼ σ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; with ἤν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __5 in indirect questions, σκεψώμεθα τοῦτο ἆ... [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II in Poets sometimes like{ἄρα}, [Refs 7th c.BC+]

  __B In Prose, ἆ. almost always stands first in the sentence, but[Refs 5th c.BC+];
  καὶ ὑπὲρ τούτων ἆ... [Refs 4th c.AD+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
