  most quickly, most speedily, ὅττι τάχιστα as soon as may be, as soon as possible,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; so ὅσον τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ᾳ (probably) τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ὅπως τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]: these are elliptically phrases,
  as may be seen from the following examples, ὡς δυνατόν ἐστι τάχιστα [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ᾗ δυνατὸν τ. [Refs]; ὡς or ᾗ ἠδύνατο τ. [Refs]; ὡς δύναιτο τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+];
