  SYN.: ζωή, is life intensive, "vita quâ, vivimus," the vital principle; βίος, life
  extensive, "vita quam vivimus," (1) the period of life, (2) the means by which it
  is sustained. Hence, in cl., ζ., being confined to the physical life common to men
  and animals, is the  inferior word (cf. zoology, biography). In NT, ζωή is elevated
  into the ethical and spiritual sphere (cf. Tr., Syn., §xxvii). (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
