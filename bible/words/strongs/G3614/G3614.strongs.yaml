  SYN.: οἶκος, which in Attic law denoted the whole estate, οἰκία, the dwelling only.
  In cl. poets οἶκος has also the latter sense, but not in prose, except in metaphorically
  usage, where it signifies both property and household. The foregoing distinction
  is not, however, consistently maintained in late Greek; cf. MM, ii, xvii, and see
  Thayer, see word οἰκία  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
