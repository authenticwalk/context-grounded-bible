  , ἦ καὶ γένει ὕστερος ἦεν [Refs]: frequently strengthened by the addition of one
  or two other Particles, as ἦ ἄρα [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἦ μήν and ἦ μέν (see. below);
  ἦ νυ [Refs 8th c.BC+] used in oaths and asseverations, [Refs 8th c.BC+]: with infinitive
  in indirect speech, after Verbs of swearing, etc., σὺ δὲ σύνθεο, καί μοι ὄμοσσον,

  σύνδεσμος) perispomenon after ἐπεί, barytone after ὅτι or τί. It is probably the
  same as the affirmative ἦ [Refs 2nd c.AD+], and occurs in the same combinations,
  ἐπεὶ ἦ πολύ.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἐπεὶ ἦ μάλα[Refs 8th c.BC+] as one word, and this
  can be supported by τί ἢ δὲ σύ.. [Refs 8th c.BC+] was two words. The Attic accentuation
  is said by [Refs]

  __I.3 this ἦ (or ἢ) is probably to be recognized in ὥς τε γὰρ ἦ [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.1 Direct questions,

  __II.1.a epexegetic of a preceding question, suggesting the answer to it, τίπτ᾽

  see.. ? [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τί δῆτα χρῄζει; ἦ με γῆς ἔξω βαλεῖ; [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  τίς σοι διηγεῖτ; ἦ αὐτὸς Σωκράτη; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.1.b not epexegetic of a preceding question, ἦ σύ γ᾽ Ὀδυσσεύς ἐσσι πολύτροπο;

  [Refs 5th c.BC+]: especially to mark the first of several questions, [Refs 5th c.BC+]
  ff.; ἦ ἄρα δή..; [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἦ ταῦτα δή..; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἦ ταῦτα δῆτα..;
  [Refs]; ἦ γάρ..; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; standing alone, is it not so? [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ἦ καί..; [Refs 4th c.BC+] —ἦ usually begins the sentence, except that the vocative

  and the κοινή to ἆρα (which see), in all other dialects [Refs 7th c.BC+]

  __II.2 Indirect questions, οἴχετο πευσόμενος μετὰ σὸν κλέος ἤ που ἔτ᾽ εἴης [Refs

  πάντα κὰτ τὰν συνθήκαν they shall investigate whether.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]
