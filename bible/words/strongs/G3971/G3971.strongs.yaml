  also ος, ον [Refs 5th c.BC+], etc.; Epic dialect and Ionic dialect πατρώϊος, η,
  ον, the only form used in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; the former first in [Refs 6th c.BC+],
  though both use the longer form, [Refs 6th c.BC+]; Thess. πατρούεος (which see):
  (πατήρ):— of or from one''s father, coming or inherited from him, σκῆπτρον, ἔγχος,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ξεῖνος πατρώϊός ἐσσι παλαιός my old hereditary friend, [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; γαῖα πατρωΐη one''s fatherland, [Refs 6th c.BC+]; δῶμα, ἑστία, κοῖται, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; πατρώϊα one''s father''s goods, patrimony, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τὰ π. [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; δοῦλοι π. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; π. δόξα hereditary glory, [Refs] of our
  fathers and grandfathers, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; π. οἰκία, κλῆρος, [Refs 5th c.BC+];

  tutelary gods of a family or people, as Apollo at Athens, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Zeus

  c.BC+]; of Orestes, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Ζεὺς π. was also the god who protects parents''

  __II ={πάτριος}, of or belonging to one''s father, μῆλα [Refs 8th c.BC+]; π. ἄεθλοι

  [Refs 4th c.BC+]; τὰ πατρώϊα the cause of one''s father, opposed to τὰ μητρώϊα,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] —Grammars  distinguished πατρῷος, as expressing patrimonial possession,
  from πάτριος as expressing hereditary manners, customs, institutions; see [Refs
  5th c.AD+]—The distinction holds in Attic dialect Prose; but [Refs 8th c.BC+] only,
  and in all these senses; so also Trag. [πάτριος should be restored in all passages
  in Trag. where the 2nd pers. syllable is made short in anapaest meter and Lyric
  poetry, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but γῆς ἀπὸ πατρωΐης ends a pentameter in [Refs] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
