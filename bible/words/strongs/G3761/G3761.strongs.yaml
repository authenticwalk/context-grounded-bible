etymology: 'οὐδέ,

  negative Particle, related to μηδέ as οὐ to μή, partly conjunction, partly adverb:

  __A CONJUNCTION, but not, mostly answering to μέν (sometimes written divisim), [Refs
  8th c.BC+], but not, is followed by οὐδέ, nor, ἄλλοις μὲν πᾶσιν ἑήνδανεν, οὐδέ ποθ᾽
  Ἥρῃ, οὐδὲ Ποσειδάων᾽, οὐδὲ γλαυκώπιδι κούρῃ [Refs]

  __A.II more frequently and not, nor: sometimes without a negative preceding, Κίρκη
  δ᾽ ὡς ἐνόησεν ἔμ᾽ ἥμενον, οὐδ᾽ ἐπὶ σίτῳ χεῖρας ἰάλλοντα [Refs 8th c.BC+]; δεινὸν
  γάρ, οὐδὲ ῥητόν [Refs 5th c.BC+]: after a negative compound, ὃν ἠτίμησ᾽ Ἀγαμέμνων,
  οὐδ᾽ ἀπέλυσε θύγατρα [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.II.2 with a negative preceding, nor, βρώμης δ᾽ οὐχ ἅπτεαι οὐ. ποτῆτος [Refs
  8th c.BC+], = and not, as in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐδέ, = nor may be repeated any number
  of times, e.g. three times in [Refs 5th c.BC+] —Sts. the _negative_ follows the
  whole word-group instead of preceding it, σιδήρῳ δὲ οὐδ᾽ ἀργύρῳ χρέωνται οὐδέν but
  iron or silver use they not at all, [Refs 5th c.BC+] never means neither.. nor (like
  οὔτε.. οὔτε); where this combination occurs, the first οὐδέ is used without reference
  to the second, e.g. καὶ μὴν οὐδ᾽ ἡ ἐπιτείχισις οὐδὲ τὸ ναυτικὸν ἄξιον φοβηθῆναι
  and moreover we have no reason to fear their fortifications, nor yet their navy,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III οὐδέ may also follow οὔτε, by an anacoluthon, as in τε.., δέ.. (see. οὔτε
  [Refs]; but οὔτε cannot follow οὐδέ.[Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B adverb, not even, in [Refs 8th c.BC+] not even a little, no not a bit, not at
  all, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; so also ἐπεὶ οὔ οἱ ἔνι φρένες οὐδ᾽ ἠβαιαί he has no sense,
  no not even a little,[Refs 8th c.BC+] he did not even exchange words with him, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]: in the same sense, οὐ. γ᾽ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Epic dialect οὐ. μέν [Refs
  8th c.BC+] —This οὐδέ frequently follows καί, and not even, καὶ οὐδ᾽ αὐτοὶ αὖ μόνον,
  ἀλλὰ καὶ.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also ἀλλ᾽ οὐδέ, most frequently in phrase ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽
  ὧς.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.II also not, not.. either, nor yet.., ὁ δίκαιος τοῦ δικαίου δοκεῖ τί σοι ἂν
  ἐθέλειν πλέον ἔχειν; Answ. οὐδαμῶς..; Qu. τί δ; τῆς δικαίας πράξεως; Answ. οὐ. τῆς
  δικαίας [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C Repetition of οὐδέ and combination with οὐ:

  __C.I in Relat. as well as antecedent clause, ὥσπερ οὐδ᾽ ηὔχετο, οὐδ᾽ ᾤετο [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __C.II οὐ γὰρ οὐδέ, as ἀλλ᾽ οὐ γὰρ οὐ. νουθετεῖν ἔξεστί σε [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ.
  γὰρ οὐ. [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐ. μὲν οὐ. [Refs 8th c.BC+]; compare οὐ with {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
