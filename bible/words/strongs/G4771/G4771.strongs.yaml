  occurs in Mat.25:39). Nom. for emphasis or contrast: Jhn.1:30, 4:10, 5:33, 39, 44,
  Act.4:7, Eph.5:32; so also perhaps σὺ εἶπας, Mat.26:64, al. (M, Pr., 86); before
  voc., Mat.2:6, Luk.1:76, Jhn.17:5, al.; sometimes without emphasis (M, Pr., 85f.),
  as also in cl., but esp. as rendering of Heb. phrase, e.g. υἱός μου εἶ σύ (בְּנִי־אַתָּה,
  Psa.2:7), Act.13:33. The genitive (σοῦ, ὑμῶν) is sometimes placed bef. the noun:
  Luk.7:48, 12:30, al.; so also the enclitic σοῦ, Mat.9:6; on τί ἐμοὶ κ. σοί, see:
  ἐγώ.
