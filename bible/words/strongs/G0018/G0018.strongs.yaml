  [in LXX chiefly for טוֹב ;]

  in general, good, in physical and in moral sense, used of persons, things, acts,
  conditions, etc., applied to that which is regarded as "perfect in its kind, so
  as to produce pleasure and satisfaction, . . . that which, in itself good, is also
  at once for the good and the advantage of him who comes in contact with it" (Cremer,
  3): γῆ, Luk.8:8; δένδρον, Mat.7:18; καρδία, Luk.8:15; δόσις, Jas.1:17; μέρις, Luk.10:42;
  ἔργον (frequently in Pl.), Php.1:6; ἐλπίς, 2Th.2:16; θησαυρός, Mat.12:35; μνεία,
  1Th.3:6 (cf. 2Ma.7:20); as subst., τὸ ἀ, that which is morally good, beneficial,
  acceptable to God, Rom.12:2; ἐργάζεσθαι τὸ ἀ, Rom.2:10, Eph.4:28; πράσσειν, Rom.9:11,
  2Co.5:10; διώκειν, 1Th.5:15; μιμεῖσθαι, III Jo 11; κολλᾶσθαι τῷ ἀ, Rom.12:9; ερωτᾶν
  περὶ τοῦ ἀ., Mat.19:17; διάκονος εἰς τὸ ἀ., Rom.13:4; τὸ ἀ. σου, thy favour, benefit,
  Phm 14; pl., τὰ ἀ., of goods, possessions, Luk.12:18; of spiritual benefits, Rom.10:15,
  Heb.9:11, 10:1. ἀ is opposite to πονηρός, Mat.5:45, 20:5; κακός, Rom.7:19; φαῦλος,
  Rom.9:11, 2Co.5:10 (cf. MM, VGT, see word).

  SYN.: καλός, δίκαιος. κ. properly refers to goodliness as manifested in form: ἀ.
  to inner excellence (cf. the cl. καλὸς κἀγαθός and ἐν καρδία κ. καὶ ἀ., Luk.8:15).
  In Rom.5:7, where it is contrasted with δ., ἀ. implies a kindliness and attractiveness
  not necessarily possessed by the δίκαιος, who merely measures up to a high standard
  of rectitude (cf. ἀγαθωσύνη). (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
