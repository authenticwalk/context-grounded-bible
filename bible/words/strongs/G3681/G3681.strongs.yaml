  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'ὄνειδ-ος, εος, τό,

  reproach, rebuke, censure, blame, especially by word, προθέουσιν ὀνείδεα μυθήσασθαι
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; εἶχε ὄ. καὶ ἀτιμίην was in disgrace, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὄ. φέρει
  it brings reproach, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς ἐν ὀνείδει by way of reproach, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; ὀνείδει ἐνέχεσθαι, συνέχεσθαι, [Refs 4th c.BC+]with censures, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __2 matter of reproach, disgrace, σοὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ.. κατηφείη καὶ ὄ. [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ὄνειδός [ἐστι] with infinitive, [Refs 5th c.BC+] the disgrace of the city, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; Oedipus calls his daughters τοιαῦτ᾽ ὀνείδη, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __3 the statement of [Refs] meant originally any report of one, reputation, character,
  is not borne out by the passages he cites— ὄ. οὐ καλόν [Refs 5th c.BC+], which are
  plainly ironical. (Cf. Sanskrit nindati, nid- ''insult'', Gothic ga-naitjan ''slander'',
  Lett. naids ''hatred''.) {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
