etymology: 'σύν [ῠ],

  old Attic dialect ξύν; Boeotian dialect σούν [Refs 3rd c.BC+];

  __A σ. ἡρώων [Refs 2nd c.AD+]:—with. The form ξύν rarely occurs in [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  in Ionic dialect verse we find ξύν [Refs 7th c.BC+]; in early Ionic dialect Prose
  (including Inscrr.,[Refs 6th c.BC+] is only found in ξυνίημι [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in
  the late Ionic of [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; in Aeolic dialect and Doric dialect it is rare,
  ξυνοίκην [Refs 7th c.BC+]; elsewhere Doric dialect σύν, [Refs 6th c.BC+] and becomes
  usual towards the end; after [Refs 5th c.BC+]; otherwise, of Attic dialect Prose
  writers [Refs 5th c.BC+] a few times in compounds; codices [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] is very frequently; in Trag. both forms occur. The preposition
  σύν gradually gave way to μετά with genitive, so that whereas [Refs 4th c.BC+] with
  genitive, the proportions in [Refs 5th c.BC+]: for these and other statistics see
  C. [Refs 1st c.AD+] T. Mommsen, Beiträge zur Lehre von den griechischen Präpositionen
  (Frankfurt 1886-95): in Attic dialect Prose and Comedy texts σύν is restricted for
  the most part to signification 8, 9 and a few phrases, such as σὺν θεῷ, σὺν (τοῖς)
  ὅπλοι; Xenophon uses it freely, having 556 examples to 275 of μετ; in Papyrus, [Refs]

  __A.1 in company with, together with, δεῦρό ποτ᾽ ἤλυθε.. σ. Μενελάῳ [NT+8th c.BC+]

  __A.2 with collateral notion of help or aid, σ. θεῷ with God''s help or blessing,
  as God wills, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; σ. θεῷ εἰρημένον spoken as by inspiration, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; so σ. δαίμονι, σ. Ἀθήνῃ καὶ Διί, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; also θεοῦ σ. παλάμᾳ,
  σ. θεοῦ τύχᾳ, [Refs 5th c.BC+] let him consult with you, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ξ. τῇ
  βουλῇ in consultation with the Council, [Refs]; σ. τινὶ μάχεσθαι fight at his side,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; σ. τινὶ εἶναι or γίγνεσθαι to be with another, i.e.on his side,
  of his party, [Refs]; οἱ σ. αὐτῷ his friends, followers, [NT]

  __A.4 of things that belong, or are attached, to a person, σ. νηΐ or σ. νηυσί, i.e.
  on board ship, [Refs 8th c.BC+] (so in Prose, σ. ναυσὶ προσπλεῖν [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  especially of arms, μιν κατέκηε σ. ἔντεσι [Refs]; ς. (or ξ.) ὅπλοις [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ς. (or ξ.) τοῖς ὅπλοις [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in some such cases ς. is little more than
  expletive, as σ. τεύχεσι θωρηχθέντες lines[Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.5 of things accompanying, or of concurrent circumstances, ἄνεμος σ. λαίλαπι
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; of coincidence in time, ἄκρᾳ σ. ἑσπέρᾳ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καιρῷ
  σ. ἀτρεκεῖ[Refs 5th c.BC+]; in the course of, κείνῳ σ. ἄματι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.6 of necessary connexion or consequence, σὺν μεγάλῳ ἀποτεῖσαι to pay with a
  great loss, i.e. suffer greatly, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; δημοσίῳ σ. κακῷ with loss to
  the public, [Refs 6th c.BC+]; σ. τῷ σῷ ἀγαθῷ to your advantage, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ὤλοντο.. σὺν μιάς ματι with pollution, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; to denote agreement, in
  accordance with, σ. τῷ δικαίῳ καὶ καλῷ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.7 of the instrument or means, with the help of, by means of, σ. ἐλαίῳ φαρμακώσαισα
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  me the seventh, [Refs 4th c.BC+]together with.., [Refs 3rd c.BC+]; οἱ γραμματεῖς
  σ. τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις [NT]

  __B POSITION:—σύν sometimes follows its case, [Refs 8th c.BC+]. It frequently stands
  between adjective and substantive, as [Refs 8th c.BC+]; more rarely between substantive
  and adjective, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.2 frequently in tmesis in [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.3 in late Gr. σὺν καὶ with dative, στεφανηφορήσας σ. καὶ Αὐρ. Ἰάσονι [Refs 1st
  c.AD+]

  __C σύν AS adverb., together, at once, κενεὰς σ. Χεῖρας ἔχοντες [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  mostly followed by δέ or τε, σ. δὲ πτερὰ πυκνὰ λίασθεν [Refs 8th c.BC+]. It is sometimes
  hard to distinguish this from tmesis, e.g. in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; so ξὺν κακῶς ποιεῖν
  is ={Ξυγκακοποιεῖν} in [Refs 5th c.BC+]. In Old Testament Gr. it is sometimes used
  to translate the Hebrew ''ēth (particle prefixed to the definite accusative) through
  confusion with the preposition ''ēth ''with'', ἐμίσησα σὺν τὴν ζωήν [LXX]; οὐκ ἐμνήσθη
  σ. τοῦ ἀνδρός[LXX+2nd c.AD+]

  __C.2 besides, also, σ. δὲ πλουτίζειν ἐμέ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in later Poetry σ. καί
  [Refs 3rd c.BC+] (also in late Prose, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __D IN COMPOSITION (joined with other words),

  __D.I with, along with, together, at the same time, hence of any kind of union,
  connexion, or participation in a thing, and metaphorically of agreement or unity.
  In Compos. with a transitive Verb σύν may refer to the Object as well as the Subject,
  as συγκατακτείνειν may mean kill one person as well as another, or, join with another
  in killing.

  __D.I.2 of the completion of an action, altogether, completely, as in συνάγνυμι,
  συνασκέω 2, συνθρύπτω, συγκόπτω, συμπατέω, συμπληρόω, συντελέω, συντέμν; sometimes,
  therefore, it seems only to strengthen the force of the simple word.

  __D.I.3 joined with numerals, σύνδυο two together, which sense often becomes distributive,
  by twos, two and two; so σύντρεις, σύμπεντε, etc., like Latin bini, terni, etc.

  __D.II σύν in Compos., before β μ π φ ψ, becomes συμ-; before γ κ ξ Χ, συγ-; before
  λ συλ-; before σ usually συσ-; but becomes συ- before σ followed by a consonant
  (e.g. συστῆναι), before ζ, and perhaps sometimes before ξ. In a poetry passage,
