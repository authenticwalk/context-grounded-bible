etymology: 'οἰκουμέν-η

  (i.e. γῆ), ἡ, inhabited region, see at {οἰκέω} [Refs 4th c.BC+]; then the Greek
  world, opposed to barbarian lands, [Refs 4th c.BC+] = the inhabited world (including
  non-Greek lands, as Ethiopia, India, Scythia), as opposed to possibly uninhabited
  regions,[Refs 4th c.BC+] = our world (= Asia, Libya, Europe); οἰκουμέναι worlds,[LXX+4th
  c.BC+]; loosely, the whole world, [Refs 4th c.BC+]: so perhaps in some passages
  cited under [Refs]

  __II the Roman world, ὁ ἀγαθὸς δαίμων (etc.) τῆς οἰ., i.e. the Emperor, [NT+1st
  c.AD+]

  __III ἡ οἰ. ἡ μέλλουσα the world to come, i.e. the kingdom of Christ, [NT] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
