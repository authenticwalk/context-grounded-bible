  SYN.: φιλέω. From its supposed etymology (Thayer, LS; but see also Boisacq) ἀ. is
  commonly understood properly to denote love based on esteem (diligo), as distinct
  from that expressed by φιλέω (amo), spontaneous natural affection, emotional and
  unreasoning. If this distinction holds, ἀ. is fitly used in NT of Christian love
  to God and man, the spiritual affection which follows the direction of the will,
  and which, therefore, unlike that feeling which is instinctive and unreasoned, can
  be commanded as a duty. (Cf. ἀγάπη, and v. Tr., Syn. §xii; Cremer, 9, 592; and esp.
  MM, VGT, see word) (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
