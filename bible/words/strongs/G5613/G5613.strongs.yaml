  __A.2 καὶ ὧς even so, nevertheless, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐδ᾽ ὧς not even so, [Refs
  8th c.BC+] are used in Trag. and Attic dialect, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; κἂν ὧς, εἴπερ
  μέλει σοι, ἀπόστειλόν μοί τινα [Refs 4th c.AD+]; δουλεύων καθὼς καὶ ὧς [Refs 2nd

  adverb, which is frequently omitted, κινήθη δ᾽ ἀγορὴ ὡς κύματα μακρὰ θαλάσσης, i.
  e. οὕτως, ὡς.., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; compare ὥτε. Usage:

  __A.I in similes, frequently in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; longer similes are commonly introduced
  by ὡς ὅτε, ὡς δ᾽ ὅτε, ἤριπε δ᾽, ὡς ὅτε πύργος [ἤριπε] [Refs]; so later, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+] is rare in short similes, [Refs 8th c.BC+] is followed by indicative present,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]aorist, [Refs]; also by subjunctive present or aorist, [Refs] (sometimes
  ὡς δ᾽ ὅτ᾽ ἄν, [Refs]; compare ὥστε A:—the Verb is sometimes omitted with ὡς, but
  may be supplied from the context, ἐνδούπησε πεσοῦσ᾽, ὡς εἰναλίη κήξ (i.e. πίπτει)

  ={ὅσον μή, νέμεν ὅτι ἃν} (={ἂν}) βόλητοι ὡς μὴ ἰν τοῖ περιχώροι [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  cf. Ab. 11.2 below

  __A.I.4 sometimes after comparative, compared with, hence than, μᾶλλον πρέπει οὕτως
  ὡς.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδενὸς μᾶλλον φροντίζειν ὡς.. [Refs 2nd c.BC+] is uncertain
  in [Refs 4th c.BC+], and [ἢ] should perhaps be inserted in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare
  ὥσπερ IV.

  __A.II with Adverbial clauses:

  __A.II.1 parenthetically, in qualifying clauses, ὡς ἔοικε, etc., [Refs 5th c.BC+]:
  in these cases γε or γοῦν is frequently added, ὡς γοῦν ὁ λόγος σημαίνει as at any
  rate the argument shows, [Refs]; in some phrases with infinitive, see below [Refs
  5th c.BC+] τὸ σφέτερον [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς γὰρ.. ἤκουσά τινος, ὅτι.. [Refs 5th

  __A.II.2 in elliptical phrases, so far as.. (compare supr. Ab.[Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ὡς ἀπ᾽ ὀμμάτων (i.e. εἰκάσαι) to judge by eyesight, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: especially
  in such phrases as οὐκέτι πολλὸν χωρίον, ὡς εἶναι Αἰγύπτου [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδὲ
  ἀδύνατος, ὡς Αακεδαιμόνιος for a Lacedaemonian, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; φρονεῖ.. ὡς γυνὴ

  __A.III with Adverbs:

  __A.III.a with the Posit., ὡς ἀληθῶς truly, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς ἑτέρως in the other
  way, [Refs 4th c.BC+] (adverb of ὁ ἕτερο; see at {ἕτερος} see 2) (see. below [Refs
  4th c.BC+]; ὡς ἠπίως, ὡς ἐτητύμως, [LXX+5th c.BC+]; ὡς ἐναλλάξ [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  in ὣς αὔτως (see. ὡσαύτως) we have the adverb of ὁ αὐτός, but the ὥς retains its
  demonstrative force, as does ὁ in Homer; ὡς ἀληθῶς, ὡς ὁμοίως, and ὡς παντελῶς may
  be modelled on ὣς αὔτως, with which they are nearly synonymous; so also ὡς ἑτέρως
  and ὡς ἐναλλάξ, which are contrasted with it.

  __A.III.b with adverbs expressing anything extraordinary, θαυμαστῶς or θαυμασίως
  ὡς, ὑπερφυῶς ὡς, (see entry).; ὡς is sometimes separated by several words from its

  easily as possible, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; ὠς τάχιστα as quickly as possible, [Refs 7th
  c.BC+]; ὡς ἀνυστὸν κάλλιστα Diog.[Refs 2nd c.AD+] are sometimes found together,
  where one is superfluous, ὡς ὅτι μάλιστα [Refs 5th c.BC+]; see infr. G.

  __A.III.d with comparative, ὡς θᾶσσον [Refs 2nd c.BC+]

  __A.III.e in the phrases ὡς τὸ πολύ, ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ

  πλῆθος, ὡς πλήθει, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2 with adjectives,

  __A.III.2.a Posit., ὑπερφυεῖ τινι.. ὡς μεγάλῃ βλάβῃ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2.b with superlative, ὡς ἄριστοι τὰς φύσεις [Refs]

  __A.III.2.c separated from the adjective by a preposition, ὡς ἐς ἐλάχιστον [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2.Ac Relat. and Interrog., how, μερμήριζε.. ὡς Ἀχιλῆα τιμήσειε [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; ὡς πέπραται how, i. e. at what price the goods have been sold, [Refs 3rd
  c.BC+]; so οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ὡς.. (for the more usually ὅπως) nowise can it be that.., [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ὡς οὐ.., [Refs]; οἶσθ᾽ ὡς πόησο; by a mixture of constructions
  for ὡς χρὴ ποιῆσαι or ὡς ποιήσεις, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οἶσθ᾽ ὡς μετεύξει is falsa
  lectio in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; similarly, οἶσθα.. ὡς νῦν μὴ σφαλῇς [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2 ὡς ἂν ποήσῃς however (in whatever way) thou mayest act, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2.Ad Temporal, when, with past tenses of the indicative, ἐνῶρτο γέλως..,
  ὡς ἴδον [Refs 8th c.BC+]: with optative, to express a repeated action, whenever,
  ὡς.. ἐς τὴν Μιλησίην ἀπίκοιτο [Refs 5th c.BC+]: rarely with subjunctive, to denote
  what happens under certain conditions, τῶν δὲ ὡς ἕκαστός οἱ μειχθῇ, διδοῖ δῶρον
  [Refs]; later, ὡς ἄν with subjunctive, when, [NT+3rd c.BC+]; ὡς ἂν τάχιστα λάβῃς
  τὴν ἐπιστολήν as soon as.. [LXX+3rd c.BC+]: in indirect speech with infinitive,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] as soon as ever.., [Refs 5th c.BC+] stand together, [Refs 4th c.BC+]:
  but this usage must be distinguished from signf. Ab.111.1c: followed by demonstrative,
  ὡς εἶδ᾽, ὣς ἀνεπᾶλτο [Refs 8th c.BC+]; the second ὣς is repeated, ἁ δ᾽ Ἀταλάντα
  ὡς ἴδεν, ὣς ἐμάνη, ὣς ἐς βαθὺν ἅλατ᾽ ἔρωτα [Refs 3rd c.BC+]

  __A.III.2 ὡς appears to be falsa lectio for{ἕως} in ὡς ἂν αὑτὸς ἥλιος.. αἴρῃ [Refs
  5th c.BC+]: but in later Gr. ={ἕως}, while, ὡς τὸ φῶς ἔχετε [NT]; also until, τίθεται

  Verbs of fear or anxiety, with future indicative, μηκέτ᾽ ἐκφοβοῦ, μητρῷον ὥς σε
  λῆμ᾽ ἀτιμάσει ποτέ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; μὴ φοβοῦ ὡς ἀπορήσεις [Refs 4th c.BC+]; a sentence
  beginning with ὡς is sometimes, when interrupted, resumed by ὅτι, and vice versa,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so ὡς with a finite Verb passes into the accusative and infinitive,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] is followed by indicative, after historic tenses by optative (sometimes
  by indicative, both constructions in ὑπίσχοντο.. ἀμυνέειν, φράζοντες ὡς οὔ σφι περιοπτέη

  c.BC+]

  __B.II with Final Clauses, that, in order that; in this sense ὡς and ὡς ἄν, Epic
  dialect ὥς κεν, are used with the subjunctive after primary tenses of the indicative,
  and with the optative after the past tenses, βουλὴν ὑποθησόμεθ᾽.., ὡς μὴ πάντες
  ὄλωνται [Refs 8th c.BC+]future indicative, ὡς μὴ ὦν αὐτοὶ τε ἀπολέεσθε (conjecture
  Cobet for ἀπόλεσθε) κἀμὲ τρώσετε, ἐς ἄλλον τινὰ δῆμον ἀποίχεσθε [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2 ὡς is also used with past tenses of the indicative to express a purpose
  which has not been or cannot be fulfilled, τί μ᾽ οὐκ ἔκτεινας, ὡς ἔδειξα μήποτε..;

  τὰς νήσους) οἱ βάρβαροι ἐσαγήνευον τοὺς ἀνθρώπους [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; rarely with
  a Verb, ὡς ἕκαστος ἀπικνέοιτο [Refs 5th c.BC+] follows ἕκαστος, ἑκάστῳ ὡς ὁ Θεὸς
  ἐμέρισεν μέτρον πίστεως [NT]:—for the etymology see infr. H; also ὡς ἑκάτεροι [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __G ὡς pleonastic in ὡς ὅτι [NT+8th c.BC+]

  __H Etymology: this word is in origin five distinct words: [Refs]as'' is the adverb
  from the Relat. ὅς (I.-[Refs 5th c.BC+] stem yo-); with ὡς βέλτιστος cf. Sanskrit
  yācchrē[snull][tnull]á[hudot] ''the best possible'': (2) ὧς ''thus'' is the adverb
  of a Demonstr. stem so- found in Sanskrit sa, Gr. ὁ, Latin sō-c ([Refs]; = ita,
  cf. Umbr. esoc); (3) ὡς postpositive (ὄρνιθες ὥς, etc.) constantly makes a preceding
  short closed syllable long in [Refs 8th c.BC+], and must therefore have been ϝω;
  it may perhaps be related to Sanskrit vā, a form of va, iva (= [Refs]like), Latin
  ve, Gr. ἦ[ϝ] ; [Refs]to'' is of doubtful origin (perhaps from *ὠς, cognate with
  Latin ōs ''face'', Sanskrit ās: ὤς τινα ἐλθεῖν like{τί δέ δε φρένας ἵκετο πένθος};);
  (5) ὡς F. 3 is probably ϝως, adverb of ϝός the reflexive adjective, and means literal
  in his (their) own way (or place); it is idiomatically placed before ἕκαστος (ἑκάτερος),compare
  ϝὸν ϝεκάτερος [Refs] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
