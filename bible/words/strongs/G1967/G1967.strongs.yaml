strongs_number: G1967
language: greek
lemma: ἐπιούσιος
transliteration: epioúsios
definition: tomorrow's; but more probably from G1909 (ἐπί) and a derivative of the
  present participle feminine of G1510 (εἰμί); for subsistence, i.e. needful
kjv_usage: daily
derivation: perhaps from the same as G1966 (ἐπιοῦσα);
extended_definition: 'ἐπιούσιος, -ον

  (cf. περιούσιος, [in LXX for סְגֻלָּה, etc.]),

  found only in the phrase ἄρτος ἐ., EV, daily; R, mg., for the coming day: Mat.6:11,
  Luk.11:3. (Several derivations find support, each pointing to a different meaning.

  __1. ἐπιοῦσα (sc. ἡμέρα) (or, ἐπὶ τὴν ἰοῦσαν (sc. ήμέραν), Zorell, see word), hence,
  for the morrow or for the coming day (R, mg.).

  __2. (a) ἐπί + οὐσία, hence, for subsistence, needful (Am. R, mg.);

  __(b) ἐπί + εἶναι in fern. ptcp. form, hence, pertaining to (the day). For renderings
  of versions and views of various writers, see reff. in DB, ext., 36 f.; DCG, ii,
  58 f., 62a; ICC on Lk, l.with The EV, daily, is based on the Vg. (Lk; OL, Mt, Lk,
  quotidianus). "It is difficult not to think that τὸν ἐ. rests upon misunderstanding
  of an original Aramaic phrase, or upon a Greek corruption" (ICC on Mt, l.with; cf.
  also Cremer, 239).†
