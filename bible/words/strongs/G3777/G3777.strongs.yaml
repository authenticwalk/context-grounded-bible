  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'οὔτε,

  adverb, (οὐ, τε) joining negative clauses, as τε joins positive, but rare in the
  simple sense and not, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὔτε γὰρ ἐκείνους διδόναι, Latin neque enim,
  [Refs]; and occasionally in later writers, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __II mostly repeated, οὔτε.., οὔτε.. neither.., nor.., Latin neque.., neque.., [Refs
  8th c.BC+], as οὔτ᾽ ἂρ.., οὔτε..; οὔτ᾽ ἂρ.., οὔτ᾽ ἂρ..; οὔτ᾽ ἄρ τε.., οὔτ᾽ ἄρα..
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὔτ᾽ ἄρ.., οὔτε τι.., or οὔτε τι.., οὔτε..,[Refs 8th c.BC+]; so
  too οὔτε.., οὔτε μὴν.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 frequently used to divide up a general negation into two or more parts, ὡς
  δ᾽ ἐν ὀνείρῳ οὐ δύναται φεύγοντα διώκειν, οὔτ᾽ ἂρ ὁ τὸν δύναται ὑποφεύγειν οὔθ᾽
  ὁ διώκειν [Refs 8th c.BC+]: without a negative preceding, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.3 within one of the two clauses distinguished by οὔτε a subordinate part may
  be introduced by οὐδέ, οὔτε γὰρ ἐκ σκίλλης ῥόδα φύεται οὐδ᾽ ὑάκινθος (οὐθ᾽ codices),
  οὐ δέ ποτ᾽ ἐκ δούλης τέκνον ἐλευθέριον [Refs 6th c.BC+] nor yet incantations, [Refs
  5th c.BC+] after clauses with μήτε, μήτε παιδεία μήτε δικαστήρια μήτε νόμοι μηδὲ
  ἀνάγκη μηδεμία [Refs]; so οὐδέ (μηδέ) may sometimes follow a single οὔτε (μήτε),
  οὐδέ ποτέ σφιν οὔτε τι πημανθῆναι ἔπι δέος, οὐδ᾽ ἀπολέσθαι neither to suffer misery,
  nor yet to die, see reading in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; but this cannot be done in some
  cases, as οὔτ᾽ ἂν ὑπό γε ἑνὸς.. πάθοι, ἴσως δ᾽ οὐδὲ ὑπὸ πλεόνων [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  by οὐδὲ μήν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδ᾽ αὖ, see above—But οὔτε (μήτε) cannot be used
  simply answering to οὐδέ (μηδέ), see at {μηδέ} [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __II.4 οὔτε may be followed by a Posit. clause with τε, οὔτ᾽ αὐτὸς κτενέει, ἀπό
  τ᾽ ἄλλους πάντας ἐρύξει he both will not kill and will defend, [Refs 8th c.BC+]:
  sometimes the negative is added after the τε, οὔτ᾽ ὦν.. καρπὸν ἔδωκαν ἄρουραι, δένδρεά
  τ᾽ οὐκ ἐθέλει.. φέρειν [Refs 5th c.BC+].. is uncertain in [Refs 5th c.BC+], but
  is found in later writers, as [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __II.5 οὔτε is frequently, by anacoluthon, followed not by a second οὔτε, but by
  some other Particle, as by οὐδέ, see above 3; by δέ alone, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.5.b in Poets, οὐ sometimes follows without any conjunctive Particle, οὐκ ἦν
  ἀλέξημ᾽ οὐδὲν οὔτε βρώσιμον, οὐ χριστόν, οὔτε πιστόν [Refs 4th c.BC+]; οὔτε πλινθυφεῖς
  δόμους.. ᾖσαν, οὐ ξυλουργίαν[Refs 5th c.BC+]: so also in the Prose of [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __II.5.c in Poets also οὔτε is sometimes replaced by οὐ, οὐ νιφετὸς οὔτ᾽ ἂρ χειμὼν
  πολὺς οὔτε ποτ᾽ ὄμβρος [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.5.d the former οὔτε is sometimes omitted, ναυσὶ δ᾽ οὔτε πεζὸς ἰών [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; νόσοι δ᾽ οὔτε γῆρας[Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __II.6 when οὔτε and μήτε correspond, each retains its proper sense, ἀναιδὴς οὔτ᾽
  εἰμὶ μήτε γενοίμην neither am I shameless, nor may I become so, [Refs 4th c.BC+]
