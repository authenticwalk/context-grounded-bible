extended_definition: 'ἄν,

  conditional particle,

  which cannot usually be separately translated in English, its force depending on
  the constructions which contain it (see further, LS, see word; WM, §xlii; M, Pr.,
  165 ff.; MM, VGT, see word).

  __1. In apodosis,

  __(i) with indic, imperfect or aor., expressing what would be or would have been
  if (εἰ with impf., aor. or plpf.) some condition were or had been fulfilled: Luk.7:39  17:6,
  Jhn.5:46, Gal.1:10, Mat.12:7  24:43, 1Co.2:8, Act.18:14, 1Jn.2:19, al. The protasis
  is sometimes understood (as also in cl.): Mat.25:27, Luk.19:23. In hypothetical
  sentences, expressing unreality, ἄν (as often in late writers, more rarely in cl.)
  is omitted: Jhn.8:39  15:24 19:11, Rom.7:7, Gal.4:15;

  __(ii) with opt., inf., ptcp. (cl.; see LS, see word; M, Int., §275; M, Pr., 167:4).

  __2. In combination with conditional, relative, temporal, and final words;

  __(i) as in cl., with subj.,

  __(a) in protasis with εἰ, in Attic contr. ἐάν, which see;

  __(b) in conditional, relative, and temporal clauses (coalescing with ὅτε, ἐπεί,
  etc.; see: ὅταν, ἐπάν, etc.), ever, soever;

  __(α) with pres., ἡνίκα, 2Co.3:15; ὃς ἄν, Rom.9:15 (LXX) 16:2, al.; ὅσοι ἄν, Luk.9:5;
  ὡς ἄν, Rom.15:24 (M, Pr., 167);

  __(β) with aor., ὃς ἄν, Mat.5:21, 22, 31; ἕως ἄν, until, Mat.2:13, Mrk.6:10, al.;
  ὡς ἄν, as soon as (M, Pr., 167), 1Co.11:34, Php.2:23. On the frequently use of ἐάν
  for ἄν with the foregoing words, see: ἐάν;

  __(ii) in late Gk., when some actual fact is spoken of, with indic.: ὅταν (which
  see); ὅπου ἄν, Mrk.6:56 (M, Pr., 168); καθότι ἄν, Act.2:45 4:35; ὡς ἄν, 1Co.12:2.

  __3. in iterative construction, with imperfect and aor. indic. (M, Pr., 167): Act.2:45
  4:35, 1Co.12:2.

  __4. with optative, giving a potential sense to a question or wish: Act.8:31 26:29.

  __5. Elliptical constructions: εἰ μή τι ἄν (M, Pr., 169), 1Co.7:5; ὡς ἄν, with inf.,
  as it were (op. cit. 167), 2Co.10:9.

  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'ἄν, [ᾰ],

  Epic dialect, Lyric poetry, Ionic dialect, [Refs 4th c.AD+], Attic dialect; also
  κεν) Epic dialect, Aeolic dialect, Thess., κᾱ Doric dialect, Boeotian dialect, El.;
  the two combined in Epic dialect (below [Refs 4th c.BC+], εἰκ ἄν[Refs 4th c.BC+]:—modal
  Particle used with Verbs to indicate that the action is limited by circumstances
  or defined by conditions. In [Refs 8th c.BC+] κε is four times as common as ἄν,
  in Lyric poetry about equally common. No clear distinction can be traced, but κε
  as an enclitic is somewhat less emphatic; ἄν is preferred by [Refs 8th c.BC+] in
  negative clauses, κε (ν) with the relative.

  __A In Simple Sentences, and in the Apodosis of Compound Sentences; here ἄν belongs
  to the Verb, and denotes that the assertion made by the Verb is dependent on a condition,
  expressed or implied: thus ἦλθεν he came, ἦλθεν ἄν he would have come (under conditions,
  which may or may not be defined), and so he might have come; ἔλθοι may he come,
  ἔλθοι ἄν he would come (under certain conditions), and so he might come.

  __A.I WITH INDICATIVE:

  __A.I.1 with historical tenses, generally imperfect and aorist, less frequently
  pluperfect, never perfect, see below,

  __A.I.1.a most frequently in apodosis of conditional sentences, with protasis implying
  nonfulfilment of a past or present condition, and apodosis expressing what would
  be or would have been the case if the condition were or had been fulfilled. The
  imperfect with ἄν refers to continued action, in [Refs 8th c.BC+] always in past
  time, except perhaps καί κε θάμ᾽ ἐνθάδ᾽ ἐόντες ἐμισγόμεθ᾽[Refs 8th c.BC+]; later
  also in present time, first in [Refs 6th c.BC+]; πολὺ ἂν θαυμαστότερον ἦν, εἰ ἐτιμῶντο
  it would be far more strange if they were honoured, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐκ ἂν νήσων
  ἐκράτει, εἰ μή τι καὶ ναυτικὸν εἶχεν he would not have been master of islands if
  he had not had also some naval power, [Refs 5th c.BC+]. The aorist strictly refers
  only to past time, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἰ τότε ταύτην ἔσχε τὴν γνώμην, οὐδὲν ἂν ὧν
  νυνὶ πεποίηκεν ἔπραξεν if he had then come to this opinion, he would have accomplished
  nothing of what he has now done, [Refs 4th c.BC+], but is used idiomatically with
  Verbs of saying, answering, etc., as we say I should have said, εἰ μὴ πατὴρ ἦσθ᾽,
  εἶπον ἄν σ᾽ οὐκ εὖ φρονεῖν[Refs 5th c.BC+]pluperfect refers to completed actions,
  as ὃ εἰ ἀπεκρίνω, ἱκανῶς ἂν ἤδη παρὰ σοῦ τὴν ὁσιότητα ἐμεμαθήκη I should have already
  learnt..,[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.I.1.b the protasis is frequently understood: ὑπό κεν ταλασίφρονά περ δέος εἷλεν
  fear would have seized even the stout-hearted (had he heard the sound), [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; τὸ γὰρ ἔρυμα τῷ στρατοπέδῳ οὐκ ἂν ἐτειχίσαντο they would not have built
  the wall (if they had not won a battle), [Refs 5th c.BC+]; πολλοῦ γὰρ ἂν ἦν ἄξια
  for (if that were so) they would be worth much, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ γὰρ ἦν ὅ τι
  ἂν ἐποιεῖτε for there was nothing which you could have done, i. e. would have done
  (if you had tried), [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A.I.1.c with no definite protasis understood, to express what would have been
  likely to happen, or might have happened in past time: ἢ γάρ μιν ζωόν γε κιχήσεαι,
  ἤ κεν Ὀρέστης κτεῖνεν ὑποφθάμενος for either you will find him alive, or else Orestes
  may already have killed him before you, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὃ θεασάμενος πᾶς ἄν τις
  ἀνὴρ ἠράσθη δάϊος εἶναι every man who saw this (the ''Seven against Thebes'') would
  have longed to be a warrior, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; especially with τάχα, which see,
  ἀλλ᾽ ἦλθε μὲν δὴ τοῦτο τοὔνειδος τάχ᾽ ἂν ὀργῇ βιασθὲν μᾶλλον ἢ γνώμῃ φρενῶν, i.
  e. it might perhaps have come, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τάχα ἂν δὲ καὶ ἄλλως πως ἐσπλεύσαντες
  (i.e. διέβησαν) and they might also perhaps have crossed by sea (to Sicily) in some
  other way, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.I.1.d ἄν is frequently omitted in apodosi with Verbs expressing obligation,
  propriety, or possibility, as ἔδει, ἐχρῆν, εἰκὸς ἦν, etc., and sometimes for rhetorical
  effect, εἰ μὴ.. ᾖσμεν, φόβον παρέσχεν it had caused (for it would have caused) fear,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.I.2 with future indicative:

  __A.I.2.a frequently in Epic dialect, usually with κεν, rarely ἄν, [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  and he will likely be angry to whom-soever I shall come, [Refs]; καί κέ τις ὧδ᾽
  ἐρέει and in that case men will say,[Refs 8th c.BC+]; so in Lyric poetry, μαθὼν
  δέ τις ἂν ἐρεῖ[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.I.2.b rarely in codices of Attic dialect Prose writers, σαφὲς ἂν καταστήσετε[Refs
  5th c.BC+]future infinitive and participle see below

  __A.II WITH SUBJUNCTIVE, only in Epic dialect, the meaning being the same as with
  the future indicative [Refs]I will take her myself, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; πείθευ, ἐγὼ
  δέ κέ τοι εἰδέω χάριν obey and if so I will be grateful, [Refs]; also with other
  persons, giving emphasis to the future, οὐκ ἄν τοι χραίσμῃ κίθαρις[Refs]

  __A.III WITH OPTATIVE (never future, rarely perfect πῶς ἂν λελήθοι [με]; [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __A.III.a in apodosis of conditional sentences, after protasis in optative with
  εἰ or some other conditional or relative word, expressing a future condition: ἀλλ᾽
  εἴ μοί τι πίθοιο, τό κεν πολὺ κέρδιον εἴη[Refs 8th c.BC+] present and aorist optative
  with κε or ἄν are sometimes used like imperfect and aorist indicative with ἄν in
  Attic, with either regular indicative or another optative in the protasis: καί νύ
  κεν ἔνθ᾽ ἀπόλοιτο.. εἰ μὴ.. νόησε κτλ., i. e. he would have perished, had she not
  perceived, etc., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; εἰ νῦν ἐπὶ ἄλλῳ ἀεθλεύοιμεν, ἦ τ᾽ ἂν ἐγὼ.. κλισίηνδε
  φεροίμην if we were now contending in another''s honour, I should now carry.., [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.b with protasis in present or future, the optative with ἄν in apodosi takes
  a simply future sense: φρούριον δ᾽ εἰ ποιήσονται, τῆς μὲν γῆς βλάπτοιεν ἄν τι μέρος
  they might perhaps damage, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.c with protasis understood: φεύγωμεν· ἔτι γάρ κεν ἀλύξαιμεν κακὸν ἦμαρ[Refs
  8th c.BC+]; οὔτε ἐσθίουσι πλείω ἢ δύνανται φέρειν· διαρραγεῖεν γὰρ ἄν for (if they
  should do so) they would burst, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸν δ᾽ οὔ κε δύ᾽ ἀνέρε.. ἀπ᾽ οὔδεος
  ὀχλίσσειαν two men could not heave the stone from the ground, i. e. would not, if
  they should try, [Refs 8th c.BC+] sometimes with reference to past time, Τυδεΐδην
  οὐκ ἂν γνοίης ποτέροισι μετείη[Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.III.d with no definite protasis implied, in potential sense: ἡδέως δ᾽ ἂν ἐροίμην
  Λεπτίνην but I would gladly ask Leptines, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; βουλοίμην ἄν I should
  like, Latin velim (but ἐβουλόμην ἄν I should wish, if it were of any avail, vellem);
  ποῖ οὖν τραποίμεθ᾽ ἄ; which way then can we turn? [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐκ ἂν μεθείμην
  τοῦ θρόνου I will not give up the throne, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; idiomatically, referring
  to the past, αὗται δὲ οὐκ ἂν πολλαὶ εἶεν but these would not (on investigation)
  prove to be many, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴησαν δ᾽ ἂν οὗτοι Κρῆτες these would be (i.
  e. would have been) Cretans, [Refs 5th c.BC+] i.e. it would not prove to be, etc.
  (for, it is not, etc.), [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.e in questions, expressing a wish: τίς ἂν θεῶν.. δοί;[Refs 5th c.BC+] as
  a mild command, exhortation, or entreaty, τλαίης κεν Μενελάῳ ἐπιπροέμεν ταχὺν ἰόν[Refs
  8th c.BC+]; σὺ μὲν κομίζοις ἂν σεαυτὸν ᾗ θέλεις you may take yourself off (milder
  than κόμιζε σεαυτόν), [Refs 5th c.BC+]; χωροῖς ἂν εἴσω you may go in, [Refs]; φράζοις
  ἄν, λέγοις ἄν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.f in a protasis which is also an apodosis: εἴπερ ἄλλῳ τῳ ἀνθρώπων πειθοίμην
  ἄν, καὶ σοὶ πείθομαι if I would trust any (other) man (if he gave me his word),
  I trust you, [Refs]; εἰ μὴ ποιήσαιτ᾽ ἂν τοῦτο if you would not do this (if you could),
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.g rarely omitted with optative in apodosis: ῥεῖα θεός γ᾽ ἐθέλων καὶ τηλόθεν
  ἄνδρα σαώσαι[Refs 8th c.BC+]; also in Trag., θᾶσσον ἢ λέγοι τις[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.h ἄν with future optative is probably always corrupt (compare [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; εἰδὼς ὅτι οὐδέν᾽ ἂν καταλήψοιτο (οὐδένα Bekk.) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.IV WITH infinitive and participle (sometimes adjective equivalent to participle,
  τῶν δυνατῶν ἂν κρῖναι[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.IV.1 present infinitive or participle:

  __A.IV.1.a representing imperfect indicative, οἴεσθε τὸν πατέρα.. οὐκ ἂν φυλάττει;
  do you think he would not have kept them safe? (οὐκ ἂν ἐφύλαττεν), [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  ἀδυνάτων ἂν ὄντων [ὑμῶν] ἐπιβοηθεῖν when you would have been unable, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.IV.1.b representing present optative, πόλλ᾽ ἂν ἔχων (representing ἔχοιμ᾽ ἄν)
  ἕτερ᾽ εἰπεῖν παραλείπω[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.IV.2 aorist infinitive or participle:

  __A.IV.2.a representing aorist indicative, οὐκ ἂν ἡγεῖσθ᾽ αὐτὸν κἂν ἐπιδραμεῖ; do
  you not think he would even have run thither? (καὶ ἐπέδραμεν ἄν), [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  ἴσμεν ὑμᾶς ἀναγκασθέντας ἄν we know you would have been compelled, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ῥᾳδίως ἂν ἀφεθείς when he might easily have been acquitted, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.IV.2.b representing aorist optative, οὐδ᾽ ἂν κρατῆσαι αὐτοὺς τῆς γῆς ἡγοῦμαι
  I think they would not even be masters of the land (οὐδ᾽ ἂν κρατήσειαν), [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; ὁρῶν ῥᾳδίως ἂν αὐτὸ ληφθέν (ληφθείη ἄν) [Refs]; οὔτε ὄντα οὔτε ἂν γενόμενα,
  i.e. things which are not and never could happen (ἃ οὔτε ἂν γένοιτο), [Refs]

  __A.IV.3 perfect infinitive or participle representing:

  __A.IV.3.a pluperfect indicative, πάντα ταῦθ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων ἂν ἑαλωκέναι (φήσειεν
  ἄν) he would say that all these would have been destroyed by the barbarians (ἑαλώκη
  ἄν), [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A.IV.3.b perfect optative, οὐκ ἂν ἡγοῦμαι αὐτοὺς δίκην ἀξίαν δεδωκέναι, εἰ.. καταψηφίσαισθε
  I do not believe they would (then) have suffered (δεδωκότες ἂν εἶεν) punishment
  enough, etc., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.IV.4 future infinitive or participle, never in Epic dialect, and probably always
  corrupt in Attic dialect, νομίζων μέγιστον ἂν σφᾶς ὠφελήσειν (to be read -ῆσαι)
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; participle is still more exceptional, ὡς ἐμοῦ οὐκ ἂν ποιήσοντος
  ἄλλα[Refs 5th c.BC+]; both are found in later Gk., νομίσαντες ἂν οἰκήσειν οὕτως
  ἄριστα[Refs 2nd c.BC+]; with participle, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B IN DEPENDENT CLAUSE[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I In the protasis of conditional sentences with εἰ, regularly with the subjunctive.
  In Attic εἰ ἄν is contracted into ἐάν, ἤν, or ἄν (ᾱ) (which see): [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ἢν ἐγγὺς ἔλθῃ θάνατος, οὐδεὶς βούλεται θνῄσκειν if death (ever) come near.., [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.2 in relative or temporal clauses with a conditional force; here ἄν coalesces
  with ὅτε, ὁπότε, ἐπεί, ἐπειδή, compare ὅταν, ὁπόταν, ἐπήν or ἐπάν (Ionic dialect
  ἐπεάν), ἐπειδάν: [Refs 8th c.BC+], ἐπήν, εὖτ᾽ ἄ; see also εἰσόκε (εἰς ὅ κε):—τάων
  ἥν κ᾽ ἐθέλωμι φίλην ποιήσομ᾽ ἄκοιτιν whomsoever of these I may wish.., [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; ὅταν δὴ μὴ σθένω, πεπαύσομαι when I shall have no strength.., [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; ἐχθρὸς γάρ μοι κεῖνος.. ὅς χ᾽ ἕτερον μὲν κεύθῃ ἐνὶ φρεσίν, ἄλλο δὲ εἴπῃ
  whoever conceals one thing in his mind and speaks another, [Refs 8th c.BC+]subjunctive
  in both the above constructions [Refs] without ἄ; also Trag. and Comedy texts, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; μέχρι and πρίν occasionally take subjunctive without ἄν in prose, e.g.
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] (μέχρι οὗ), [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.3 in final clauses introduced by relative adverbs, as ὡς, ὅπως (of Manner),
  ἵνα (of Place), ὄφρα, ἕως, etc. (of Time), frequently in Epic dialect, σαώτερος
  ὥς κε νέηαι[Refs 8th c.BC+]; also after ὡς in [Refs 5th c.BC+] indicative is regular
  in _Attic dialect_); ἵνα final does not take ἄν or κε except ἵνα εἰδότες ἤ κε θάνωμεν
  ἤ κεν.. φύγοιμεν[Refs 8th c.BC+] = where in [Refs 5th c.BC+] = lest, takes ἄν only
  with optative in apodosis, as [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II in Epic dialect sometimes with OPTATIVE as with subjunctive (always κε (ν),
  except εἴ περ ἂν αὐταὶ Μοῦσαι ἀείδοιεν[Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὥς κε.. δοίη ᾧ κ᾽ ἐθέλοι
  that he might give her to whomsoever he might please,[Refs 8th c.BC+] belongs to
  Verb in apodosis, as in ὡς δ᾽ ἂν ἥδιστα ταῦτα φαίνοιτο[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2 rarely in oratio obliqua, where a relative or temporary word retains an
  ἄν which it would have with subjunctive in direct form, [Refs 5th c.BC+]:—similarly
  after a preceding optative, οὐκ ἀποκρίναιο ἕως ἂν.. σκέψαιο[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III rarely with εἰ and INDICATIVE in protasis, only in Epic dialect:

  __B.III.1 with future indicative as with subjunctive: αἴ κεν Ἰλίου πεφιδήσεται[Refs
  8th c.BC+]

  __B.III.2 with εἰ and a past tense of indicative, once in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; so Ζεὺς
  γάρ κ᾽ ἔθηκε νῆσον εἴ κ᾽ ἐβούλετο Oracle texts cited in [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.IV in later Greek, ἄν with relative words is used with INDICATIVE in all tenses,
  as ὅπου ἂν εἰσεπορεύετο[NT+4th c.AD+]; ἔνθ᾽ ἂν πέφυκεν ἡ ὁλότης εἶναι[Refs 6th c.AD+];
  compare ἐάν, ὅταν.

  __C with imperfect and more rarely aorist indicative in ITERATIVE construction,
  to express elliptically a condilion fulfilled whenever an opportumty offered; frequently
  in [Refs 5th c.BC+] she would (i. e. used to) weep and lament, 3.119; εἶτα πῦρ ἂν
  οὐ παρῆν[Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴ τινες ἴδοιεν.., ἀνεθάρσησαν ἄν whenever they saw it,
  on each occasion, [Refs 5th c.BC+]infinitive representing imperfect of this construction,
  ἀκούω Λακεδαιμονίους τότε ἐμβαλόντας ἂν.. ἀναχωρεῖν, i. e. I hear they used to retire
  (ἀνεχώρουν ἄν), [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __D GENERAL REMARKS:

  __D.I POSITION OF ἄν.

  __D.I.1 in A, when ἄν does not coalesce with the relative word (as in ἐάν, ὅταν),
  it follows directly or is separated only by other particles, as μέν, δέ, τε, γάρ,
  καί, νυ, περ,, etc.; as εἰ μέν κεν.. εἰ δέ κε[Refs 8th c.BC+]; rarely by τις, as
  ὅποι τις ἄν, οἶμαι, προσθῇ[Refs 8th c.BC+] two such Particles may precede κε, as
  εἴ περ γάρ κεν[Refs 8th c.BC+]; εἰ γάρ τίς κε, ὃς μὲν γάρ κε, [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  rarely in Prose, ὅποι μὲν γὰρ ἄν[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __D.I.2 in apodosis, ἄν may stand either next to its Verb (before or after it),
  or after some other emphatic word, especially an interrogative, a negative (e. g.
  οὐδ᾽ ἂν εἷς, οὐκ ἂν ἔτι, etc.), or an important Adjective or Adverb; also after
  a participle which represents the protasis, λέγοντος ἄν τινος πιστεῦσαι οἴεσθ; do
  you think they would have believed it if any one had told them? (εἴ τις ἔλεγεν,
  ἐπίστευσαν ἄν), [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __D.I.3 ἄν is frequently separated from its infinitive by such Verbs as οἴομαι,
  δοκέω, φημί, οἶδα, etc., οὐκ ἂν οἴει..; frequently in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καὶ νῦν
  ἡδέως ἄν μοι δοκῶ κοινωνῆσαι I think that I should, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἃ μήτε προῄδει
  μηδεὶς μήτ᾽ ἂν ᾠήθη τήμερον ῥηθῆναι (where ἄν belongs to ῥηθῆναι) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __D.I.4 ἄν never begins a sentence, or even a clause after a comma, but may stand
  first after a parenthetic clause, ἀλλ᾽, ὦ μέλ᾽, ἄν μοι σιτίων διπλῶν ἔδει[Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __D.II REPETITION OF ἄν:—in apodosis ἄν may be used twice or even three times with
  the same Verb, either to make the condition felt throughout a long sentence, or
  to emphasize certain words, ὥστ᾽ ἄν, εἰ σθένος λάβοιμι, δηλώσαιμ᾽ ἄν[Refs 5th c.BC+];
  attached to a parenthetical phrase, ἔδρασ᾽ ἄν, εὖ τοῦτ᾽ ἴσθ᾽ ἄν, εἰ.. [Refs]

  __D.II.2 ἄν is coupled with κε (ν) a few times in [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __D.III ELLIPSIS OF VERB:—sometimes the Verb to which ἄν belongs must be supplied,
  in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἂν πρὸ τοῦ (i.e. ἔρρεγκον) [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τί δ᾽
  ἂν δοκεῖ σοι Πρίαμος (i.e. πρᾶξαι), εἰ τάδ᾽ ἤνυσε;[Refs 4th c.BC+] —so in phrases
  like{πῶς γὰρ ἄν}; and πῶς οὐκ ἄν (i.e. εἴη); also in ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ (or ὡσπερανεί),
  as φοβούμενος ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ παῖς (i. e. ὥσπερ ἂν ἐφοβήθη εἰ παῖς ἦν) [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  so τοσοῦτον ἐφρόνησαν, ὅσον περ ἂν (i.e. ἐφρόνησαν) εἰ..[Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare
  κἄν:—so the Verb of a protasis containing ἄν may be understood, ὅποι τις ἂν προσθῇ,
  κἂν μικρὰν δύναμιν (i. e. καὶ ἐὰν προσθῇ) [Refs 4th c.BC+]; ὡς ἐμοῦ οὖν ἰόντος ὅπῃ
  ἂν καὶ ὑμεῖς (i.e. ἴητε) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __D.IV ELLIPSIS OF ἄν:—when an apodosis consists of several co-ordinate clauses,
  ἄν is generally used only in the first and understood in the others: πείθοι᾽ ἂν
  εἰ πείθοι᾽· ἀπειθοίης δ᾽ ἴσως[Refs 4th c.BC+]: even when the construction is continued
  in a new sentence, [Refs 5th c.BC+] is repeated for the sake of clearness or emphasis,[Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __B ἄν, [ᾱ], Attic dialect, ={ἐάν},{ἤν}, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἂν θεὸς θέλῃ[Refs 4th
  c.BC+]: not common in earlier Attic dialect Inscrr., [NT+4th c.BC+]

  __C ἄν or ἀν, Epic form of ἀνά, (which see)

  __D ἄν, shortened from ἄνα, see entry ἀνά G. {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
