etymology: 'κἄν

  (not κᾄν), by crasis,

  __I for καὶ ἄν.., variant in [Refs 8th c.BC+] is simply copulative, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  but frequently when καί is intensive, ὅ γε κ. μέγα δοίη even a great thing, [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; sometimes repeated after or before a Verb with ἄν, ἐπεὶ κ. σὺ.., εἴ
  τίς σε διδάξειεν.., βελτίων ἂν γένοιο [Refs 5th c.BC+]; frequently in the phrase
  κ. εἰ, where καί properly belongs to εἰ, even if, and ἄν to the Verb that follows
  in apodosi, νῦν δέ μοι δοκεῖ, κ. ἀσέβειαν εἰ καταγιγνώσκοι, τὰ προσήκοντα ποιεῖν
  (for καὶ εἰ καταγιγνώσκοι, ποιεῖν ἄν) [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __I.2 even when the Verb in apodosi was of a tense that could not be joined with
  ἄν, κ. εἰ πολλαὶ [αἱ ἀρεταί].. εἰσιν, ἕν γέ τι εἶδος ταὐτὸν ἅπασαι ἔχουσι [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __I.3 in later Gr. without εἰ, simply as a stronger form of καί, even, εἴσελθε κ.
  νῦν [NT+5th c.BC+]; κ. νῦν now at any rate, [Refs 3rd c.AD+]; κἂν ὧς even so, nevertheless,
  [Refs 3rd c.AD+]; οἷς οὐδὲ κ. ὄνος ὑπῆρξε πώποτε [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __II for καὶ ἄν (ἐάν), even if, with the same moods as ἐάν, [Refs 5th c.BC+], and
  so probably in [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 κἄν.., κἄν.., whether.., or.., κἂν μεγάλην πόλιν οἰκῶσι κἂν μικράν [Refs
  4th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
