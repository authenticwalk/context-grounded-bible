  __A.3 in wishes or prayers, so, i.e. if you grant my prayer, οὕτως ἔρως σοι.. τελεσφόρος
  γένοιτο [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also in protestations, so, i.e. only if what I say is
  true, οὕτως ὀναίμην τῶν τέκνων, μισῶ τὸν ἄνδρ᾽ (as in Engl., so help me God, so

  i.e. without a dentifrice, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also, off-hand, at once, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; ἀλλ᾽ οὕτως ἄπει ; so, without a word more.. ? [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἢ στραφεὶς
  οὕτως ἴω ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς οὕτω γ᾽ ἀκοῦσαι at first hearing, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  οὐ.. οὕτως ἄπει, = impune, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.V as Hebraism, οὕτως, = such a person (thing), οὕτως οὐδέποτε εἴδαμεν [LXX+NT]

  __B Position of οὕτω or οὕτως, mostly before the word which it limits, but in Poets
  sometimes after, καλὸς οὕτω [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἔρημος οὕτω, ἄγαν οὕτω, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]: rarely at the end of a clause, [Refs 8th c.BC+]: sometimes separated from
  the word which it limits, οὕτως ἔχει τι δεινόν ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὕτω δ᾽ ἦν ὁ
  Φίλιππος ἐν φόβῳ.., ὥστε.. [Refs 4th c.BC+]
