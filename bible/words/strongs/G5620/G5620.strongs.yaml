etymology: 'ὥστε,

  as adverb, bearing the same relation to ὡς as ὅστε to ὅς, and used by [Refs 8th
  c.BC+] more frequently than ὡς in similes, when it is commonly written divisim,
  and is relative to a demonstrative ὥς: sometimes with present Indic., [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]: sometimes with aorist, ὥς τε λέων ἐχάρη [Refs]subjunctive present or aorist,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]: all three usages combined in one simile, with varied construction,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]:—the verb is sometimes omitted, λάμφ᾽ ὥς τε στεροπή [Refs] is chiefly
  Epic dialect [Refs 5th c.BC+], but it occurs in [Refs 7th c.BC+]

  __II to mark the power or virtue by which one does a thing, as being, inasmuch as,
  like{ἅτε}, τὸν δ᾽ ἐξήρπαξ᾽ Ἀφροδίτη ῥεῖα μάλ᾽, ὥ. θεός [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὥ. περὶ
  ψυχῆς since it was for life, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B as conjunction to express the actual or intended result of the action in the

  πιθέσθαι not of such age as to obey a master in all things, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὥ.
  ἀποπλησθῆναι (ἀποπλῆσαι codices) τὸν χρησμόν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also in Trag. and
  Attic dialect after demonstratives, οὔπω τοσοῦτον ἠπατημένος κυρῶ ὥστ᾽ ἄλλα χρῄζειν
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; this construction is found in cases where (as in [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  seems superfluous; so after ἐθέλειν, Κύπρις.. ἤθελ᾽ ὥ. γίγνεσθαι τόδε [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; after ἔστι, for ἔξεστι, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; after ψηφίζεσθαι, [Refs 5th c.BC+];

  σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ῥίπτειν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.4 sometimes implying on condition that.., like{ἐφ᾽ ᾧτε}, παραδοῦναι σφᾶς αὐτοὺς
  Ἀθηναίοις, ὥστε βουλεῦσαι ὅ τι ἂν ἐκείνοις δοκῇ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II with Indic., to express the actual or possible result with emphasis, οὐκ
  οὕτω φρενοβλαβὴς ὁ Πρίαμος οὐδὲ οἱ ἄλλοι.., ὥ. κινδυνεύειν ἐβούλοντο [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ἀσθενέες οὕτω, ὥ... διατετρανέεις [Refs]; οὕτως ἀγνωμόνως ἔχετε, ὥ. ἐλπίζετε..;
  are you so foolish that you expect.. ? [Refs 5th c.BC+]; with ἄν and the imperfect

  ὥστ᾽.. ὄλωλα καί σε προσδιαφθερῶ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; before a question, ὥ. τίς ἂν
  ἀπετόλμησε..; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.3 with optative, with ἄν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; after optative in principal clause,
  [Refs]

  __B.II.4 with subjunctive, in order that, in Thessalian dialect, τὸς ταμίας φροντίσαι
  οὕστε.. γενειθεῖ τᾶ πόλι ἁ δόσις [Refs]

  __B.III with participle, instead of infinitive, after a participle in the principal
  clause, τοσοῦτον ἁπάντων διενεγκόντες, ὥσθ᾽ ὑπὲρ Ἀργείων δυστυχησάντων Θηβαίοις..
  ἐπιτάττοντες κτλ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὕτω σφόδρα μισοῦντα τοῦτον, ὥστε πολὺ δὴ (ἂν
