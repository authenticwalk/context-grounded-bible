  life, λύθη ψ. τε μένος τε [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι at hazard of their
  lives, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; λίσσου᾽ ὑπὲρ ψ. καὶ γούνων by your life,[Refs 5th c.BC+]
  to save their life, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὃ ἂν θέλῃ, ψυχῆς ὠνεῖται [θυμός] in exchange

  ψ. satisfaction for the life of [NT+5th c.BC+]; δεῖρον ἄχρις ἡ ψ... ἐπὶ χειλέων
  λειφθῇ within an inch of his life, [Refs 3rd c.BC+] —the phrase ἐν τῇ χειρὶ τὴν
  ψ. ἔχοντα taking his life in his hands, is probably falsa lectio in [LXX+4th c.BC+];
  of life in animals, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἡ φύσις τοιαύτη πάντων ὅσσα ψ. ἔχει Democrit.278;
  ἐπῴζει καὶ ποιεῖ ψ. ἔχειν (of incubation) [LXX+5th c.BC+]; ἡ ψ. πάσης σαρκὸς αἷμα
  αὐτοῦ ἐστιν[LXX]

  καὶ τὰς κινήσεις μιμεῖται, στερεμνιώδη δὲ ὑπόστασιν οὐδεμίαν ἔχει εἰς ἀντίληψιν
  καὶ ἁφήν [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ψ. καὶ εἴδωλον [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ψυχὰς ἡρώων, opposed
  to αὐτούς,[Refs 8th c.BC+]; sometimes hardly distinct from signification[Refs];
  in swoons it leaves the body, τὸν δὲ λίπε ψ. [Refs]; so in later writers (seldom
  in Trag.), σὺν Ἀγαμεμνονίᾳ ψυχᾷ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἑὰν ψυχὰν κομίξαι[Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ψ. σοφαί, perhaps ''wise ghosts'', [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  ἀνδιδοῖ [Φερσεφόνα] ψυχὰς πάλιν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; αἰθὴρ μὲμ ψυχὰς ὑπεδέξατο, σώ[ματα

  ψ. πολλαὶ ἔθανον many souls perished, [NT+5th c.BC+]; in referring to persons, ὅταν
  μεγάλη ψ. φυῇ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καλεῖται γοῦν ἡ ψ. Κρινοκοράκα the creature, [NT+4th
  c.BC+]: generally, being, ψυχὴ ζῶσα living creature, [LXX]

  proverbial of friends, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; ψ. μία ἤστην probably in [Refs 2nd c.AD+];

  conscious of innocence, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἀπὸ τῆς ψ. φιλεῖν with all the heart,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐκ ἐᾷ ἡμᾶς οὐδὲ ψυχῆς λαχεῖν he won''t let us call our soul our

  consciousness, ὁρίζονται πάντες (i.e. οἱ πρότεροι) τὴν ψ. τρισίν, κινήσει, αἰσθήσει,
  τῷ ἀσωμάτῳ [Refs 4th c.BC+]; ψυχῇσιν θάνατος ὕδωρ γενέσθαι, ὕδατι δὲ θάνατος γῆν
  γενέσθαι, ἐκ γῆς δὲ ὕδωρ γίνεται, ἐξ ὕδατος δὲ ψ. (i.e. πῦρ) [Refs 6th c.BC+]; καρδία
  ψυχῆς καὶ αἰσθήσιος [ἀρχά] [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Δημόκριτος πῦρ τι καὶ θερμόν θησιν
  αὐτὴν (i.e. ψυχὴν) εἶναι[Refs]

  __V.2 the spirit of the universe, ψ. εἰς τὸ μέσον [τοῦ κόσμου] θείς [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ἐν τῷ ὅλῳ τινὲς [τὴν ψ.] μεμεῖχθαί φασιν, ὅθεν ἴσως καὶ Θαλῆς ᾠήθη πάντα πλήρη θεῶν
  εἶναι[Refs 3rd c.BC+]; ψ. [κόσμου] [Refs 1st c.AD+]; περὶ ψυχᾶς κόσμου καὶ φύσιος,
  title of work by [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __V.3 In [Refs 5th c.BC+] the immaterial principle of movement and life, ὅταν παρῇ
  [ψυχὴ] τῷ σώματι, αἴτιόν ἐστι τοῦ ζῆν αὐτῷ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; its presence is requisite
  for thought, σοφία καὶ νοῦς ἄνευ ψ. οὐκ ἂν γενοίσθην [Refs 4th c.BC+]; the tripartite
  division of ψ., οἱ δὲ περὶ Πλάτωνα καὶ Ἀρχύτας καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ Πυθαγόρειοι τὴν ψ.
  τριμερῆ ἀποφαίνονται, διαιροῦντες εἰς λογισμὸν καὶ θυμὸν καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; in the Stoics and Epicureans, σῶμα ἡ ψ. Zeno and [Refs 3rd c.BC+]; of the
  scala naturae, τὰ μὲν ἕξει διοικεῖται, τὰ δὲ φύσει, τὰ δ᾽ ἀλόγῳ ψ., τὰ δὲ καὶ λόγον
  ἐχούσῃ καὶ διάνοιαν [Refs 4th c.BC+]; in the Neo-Platonists characterized by discursive
  thinking, τοὺς λογισμοὺς ψυχῆς εἶναι ἐνεργήματα [Refs 3rd c.AD+]; related to νοῦς
  as image to archetype, εἰκών τίς ἐστι νοῦ [ψ.] [Refs]; present in entirety in every
  part, πάρεστι πᾶσα πανταχοῦ ψ. [Refs]; animal and vegetable bodies possess οἷον
  σκιὰν ψυχῆς [Refs 5th c.AD+]

  __VI butterfly or moth, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __VI.2 τριπόλιον, Ps.-[Refs 1st c.AD+]

  __VII Psyche, in the allegory of Psyche and Eros, [Refs 8th c.BC+] ''blow, breathe'';
  τὸν δὲ λίπε ψ. [Refs 8th c.BC+] means ''his spirit left his body'', and so λειποψυχέω
  means ''swoon'', not ''become breathless''; ἀπὸ δὲ ψ. ἐκάπυσσε [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  means ''she gasped out her spirit'', i.e.  ''swooned''; the resemblance of ἄμπνυτο
  ''recovered consciousness'' to ἀμπνέω ''recover breath'' is deceptive, see at {ἄμπνυτο,
  ἔμπνυτο}: when concrete the Homeric ψ. is rather warm blood than breath,[Refs 8th
  c.BC+] escapes through a wound; compare ψυχοπότης, ψυχορροφέω, and [Refs 5th c.BC+]
