etymology: 'Related to:  εἰ,

  Attic dialect-Ionic dialect and [Refs 4th c.AD+] ἤ [Refs] in Epic dialect:— Particle
  used interjectionally with imperative and to express a wish, but usually either
  in conditions, if, or in indirect questions, whether. In the former use its regular
  negative is μ; in the latter, οὐ.

  __A INTERJECTIONALLY, in [Refs 8th c.BC+], come now! with imperative, εἰ δὲ.. ἄκουσον
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  ξυνείη μοῖρα [Refs 8th c.BC+]; of unattained wishes, in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; later
  with past tenses of indicative, εἰ γάρ μ᾽ ὑπὸ γῆν.. ἧκεν [Refs 4th c.BC+]; εἰ γὰρ
  τοσαύτην δύναμιν εἶχον ὥστε.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]infinitive (compare the use of infinitive
  in commands), αἰ γὰρ τοῖος ἐὼν.. ἐμὸς γαμβρὸς καλέεσθαι [Refs]

  __A.2.b εἴθε, Epic dialect αἴθε, is frequently used in wishes in the above constructions,
  εἴθε οἱ αὐτῷ Ζεὺς ἀγαθὸν τελέσειεν [Refs 8th c.BC+]: later with infinitive, γαίης
  χθαμαλωτέρη εἴθε.. κεῖσθαι [Refs 1st c.BC+]

  __A.2.c εἰ γάρ, εἴθε are also used with ὤφελον (Epic dialect ὤφελλον), of past unattained
  wishes, αἴθ᾽ ὤφελλες στρατοῦ ἄλλου σημαίνειν [Refs 8th c.BC+]; εἰ γὰρ ὤφελον [κατιδεῖν]

  αἰ γὰρ τοῦτο.. ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη· τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]; sometimes
  hard to distinguish from εἰ in conditions (which may be derived from this use),
  εἴ μοί τι πίθοιο, τό κεν πολὺ κέρδιον εἴη [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B IN CONDITIONS, if:

  __B.I with INDIC.,

  __B.I.1 with all tenses (for future, see below [Refs]if this is so, it will be..,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]: any form of the Verb may stand in apodosi, εἰ θεοί τι δρῶσιν αἰσχρόν,

  if these were right in their revolt, (it would follow that) you rule when you have
  no right, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  express a future supposition emphatically, εἰ φθάσομεν τοὺς πολεμίους κατακαίνοντες
  οὐδεὶς ἡμῶν ἀποθανεῖται [Refs 5th c.BC+] in threats or warnings, εἰ μὴ καθέξεις
  γλῶσσαν ἔσται σοι κακά [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  action in past time (in [Refs 8th c.BC+], if they did not live an abstemious life,

  naval force, [Refs 7th c.BC+]; εἰ ἦσαν ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ.. οὐκ ἄν ποτε ταῦτα ἔπασχον

  time, λοιπὸν δ᾽ ἂν ἦν ἡμῖν ἔτι περὶ τῆς πόλεως διαλεχθῆναι, εἰ μὴ προτέρα τῶν ἄλλων
  τὴν εἰρήνην ἐπεποίητο if she had not (as she has done) made peace before the rest,

  cited in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; occasionally in Trag., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; very rarely
  in Attic dialect Prose, εἰ ξυστῶσιν αἱ πόλεις [Refs 5th c.BC+]: in later Prose,
  εἴ τις θελήσῃ [NT+3rd c.AD+]

  __B.II.1 when the apodosis is future, to express a future condition more distinctly
  and vividly than εἰ with optative, but less so than εἰ with future indicative (above
  [Refs]; εἰ δέ κεν ὣς ἕρξῃς καί τοι πείθωνται Ἀχαιοί, γνώσῃ ἔπειθ᾽.. if thou do thus..,
  thou shalt know, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἂν μὴ νῦν ἐθέλωμεν ἐκεῖ πολεμεῖν αὐτῷ, ἐνθάδ᾽
  ἴσως ἀναγκασθησόμεθα τοῦτο ποιεῖν if we be not now willing, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2 when the apodosis is present, denoting customary or repeated action, to
  express a general condition, if ever, ἤν ποτε δασμὸς ἵκηται, σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον
  (i.e. ἐστί) whenever a division comes, your prize is (always) greater, [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; ἢν ἐγγὺς ἔλθῃ θάνατος, οὐδεὶς βούλεται θνῄσκειν if death come near, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; with ἄν omitted, εἴ περ γάρ τε χόλον.. καταπέψῃ ἀλλά.. ἔχει κότον [Refs
  8th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2.b with Rhet. present in apodosis, ἐὰν μὴ οἱ φιλόσοφοι βασιλεύσωσιν, οὐκ
  ἔστι κακῶν παῦλα there is (i.e. can be, will be) no rest.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III with OPTATIVE (never with ἄν in early Gr., later ἐάν with optative, [Refs
  5th c.AD+]

  __B.III.1 to express a future condition less definitely than ἐάν with subjunctive,
  usually with optative with ἄν in apodosis, ἦ κεν γηθήσαι Πρίαμος Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες..
  εἰ σφῶιν τάδε πάντα πυθοίατο μαρναμένοιιν surely they would exult, if they should
  hear.., [Refs 8th c.BC+]: future optative is falsa lectio in [Refs 5th c.BC+]: with
  present indicative in apodosis, [Refs 6th c.BC+]: with future indicative, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __B.III.1.b in Hom.sometimes with present optative, to express an unfulfilled present
  condition, εἰ μὲν νῦν ἐπὶ ἄλλῳ ἀεθλεύοιμεν, ἦ τ᾽ ἂν ἐγὼ τὰ πρῶτα φεροίμην if we
  were now contending, etc., [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.III.2 when the apodosis is past, denoting customary or repeated action, to express
  a general condition in past time (corresponding to use of subjunctive in present
  time, above [Refs]; once in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; εἰ δέ τινας θορυβουμένους αἴσθοιτο..,
  κατασβεννύναι τὴν ταραχὴν ἐπειρᾶτο if he should see (whenever he saw) any troops
  in confusion, he (always) tried, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴ τις ἀντείποι, εὐθὺς ἐτεθνήκει
  if any one made objection, he was a dead man at once, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: indicative
  and optative are found in same sentence, ἐμίσει, οὐκ εἴ τις κακῶς πάσχων ἠμύνετο,
  ἀλλ᾽ εἴ τις εὐεργετούμενος ἀχάριστος φαίνοιτο [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III.3 in oratio obliqua after past tenses, representing ἐάν with subjunctive
  or εἰ with a primary (never an historical) tense of the indicative in oratio recta,
  ἐλογίζοντο ὡς, εἰ μὴ μάχοιντο, ἀποστήσοιντο αἱ πόλεις (representing ἐὰν μὴ μαχώμεθα,
  ἀποστήσονται) [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἔλεγεν ὅτι, εἰ βλαβερὰ πεπραχὼς εἴη, δίκαιος εἴη
  ζημιοῦσθαι (representing εἰ βλαβερὰ πέπραχε, δίκαιός ἐστι)[Refs]; εἰ δέ τινα φεύγοντα
  λήψοιτο, προηγόρευεν ὅτι ὡς πολεμίῳ χρήσοιτο (representing εἴ τινα λήψομαι, χρήσομαι)
  [Refs]; also, where oratio obliqua is implied in the leading clause, οὐκ ἦν τοῦ
  πολέμου πέρας Φιλίππῳ, εἰ μὴ Θηβαίους.. ἐχθροὺς ποιήσειε τῇ πόλει, i.e. Philip thought
  there would be no end to the war, unless he should make.. (his thought having been
  ἐὰν μὴ ποιήσω), [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III.4 with optative with ἄν, only when the clause serves as apodosis as well
  as protasis,[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.IV with infinitive, in oratio obliqua, only in [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.V after Verbs denoting wonder, delight, indignation, disappointment, contentment,
  and similar emotions, εἰ with indicative is used instead of ὅτι, to express the
  object of the feeling in a hypothetical form, θαυμάζω εἰ μηδεὶς ὑμῶν μήτ᾽ ἐνθυμεῖται
  μήτ᾽ ὀργίζεται, ὁρῶν.. I wonder that no one of you is either concerned or angry
  when he sees.., [Refs 4th c.BC+]: after past tenses, ἐθαύμασε δ᾽ εἰ μὴ φανερόν ἐστιν
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἐθαύμαζε δ᾽ εἴ τις ἀρετὴν ἐπαγγελλόμενος ἀργύριον πράττοιτο he
  wondered that any one should demand money, [Refs]; ἔχαιρον ἀγαπῶν εἴ τις ἐάσοι I
  rejoiced, being content if any one should let it pass, [Refs 5th c.BC+] —in this
  use the _negative_ οὐ is also found, ἀγανακτῶ εἰ ὁ Φίλιππος ἁρπάζων οὐ λυπεῖ [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __B.VI in citing a fact as a ground of argument or appeal, as surely as, since,
  εἴ ποτ᾽ ἔην γε if there was [as there was], i.e. as sure as there was such an one,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; πολλοὺς γὰρ οἶκε εἶναι εὐπετέστερον διαβάλλειν ἢ ἕνα, εἰ Κλεομένεα
  μὲν μοῦνον οὐκ οἷός τε ἐγένετο διαβαλεῖν, τρεῖς δὲ μυριάδας Ἀθηναίων ἐποίησε τοῦτο
  it seems easier to deceive many than one, if (as was the fact, i.e. since) he was
  not able.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.VII ELLIPTICAL CONSTRUCTIONS:

  __B.VII.1 with apodosis implied in the context, εἰ having the force of in case,
  supposing that, πρὸς τὴν πόλιν, εἰ ἐπιβοηθοῖεν, ἐχώρουν they marched towards the
  city [so as to meet the citizens], in case they should rush out, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ἱκέται πρὸς σὲ δεῦρ᾽ ἀφίγμεθα, εἴ τινα πόλιν φράσειας ἡμῖν εὔερον we have come hither
  to you, in case you should tell us of some fleecy city (i.e. that we might hear
  of it), [Refs 5th c.BC+]; παρέζεο καὶ λαβὲ γούνων, αἴ κέν πως ἐθέλῃσιν ἐπὶ Τρώεσσιν
  ἀρῆξαι sit by him and grasp his knees [so as to persuade him], in case he be willing

  [Refs]

  __B.VII.2 with apodosis suppressed for rhetorical reasons, εἴ περ γάρ κ᾽ ἐθέλῃσιν
  Ὀλύμπιος.. στυφελίξαι if he wish to thrust him away, [he will do so], [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; εἰ μὲν δώσουσι γέρας—· εἰ δέ κε μὴ δώωσιν, ἐγὼ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἕλωμαι if they
  shall give me a prize, [well and good]; but if they give not, then I will take one
  for myself, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καὶ ἢν μὲν ξυμβῇ ἡ πεῖρα—· εἰ δὲ μή.. and if the attempt
  succeed, [well]; otherwise.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  yet.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.VII.3.b εἰ δὲ μή but if not, i.e. otherwise, προηγόρευε τοῖς Λαμψακηνοῖσι μετιέναι
  Μιλτιάδεα, εἰ δὲ μή, σφέας πίτυος τρόπον ἀπείλεε ἐκτρίψειν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; after
  μάλιστα μέν, [Refs 5th c.BC+] —after a preceding _negative_, μὴ τύπτ᾽· εἰ δὲ μή,
  σαυτόν ποτ᾽ αἰτιάσει don''t beat me; otherwise, you will have yourself to blame,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.VII.3.c εἰ δέ sometimes stands for εἰ δὲ μή, εἰ μὲν βούλεται, ἑψέτω· εἰ δ᾽,
  ὅτι βούλεται, τοῦτο ποιείτω [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἰ δὲ τοῦτο and if so, [Refs 1st c.BC+]

  __B.VII.3.d εἰ γάρ for if so, [Refs]

  __C.2 with SUB[Refs 1st c.AD+]subjunctive in the direct question, τὰ ἐκπώματα οὐκ
  οἶδ᾽ εἰ Χρυσάντᾳ τουτῳῒ δῶ whether I should give them, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.3 OPT. after past tenses, representing either of the two previous constructions
  in the direct question, ἤρετο εἴ τις ἐμοῦ εἴη σοφώτερος he asked whether any one
  was wiser than I (direct ἔστι τις σοφώτερο;), [Refs 5th c.BC+]aorist optative for
  the aorist indicative, ἠρώτων αὐτὸν εἰ ἀναπλεύσειεν I asked him whether he had set
  sail (direct ἀνέπλευσα;), [Refs 4th c.BC+]aorist optative usually represents aorist
  subjunctive, τὸν θεὸν ἐπήροντο εἰ παραδοῖεν Κορινθίοις τὴν πόλιν.. καὶ τιμωρίαν
  τινὰ πειρῷντ᾽ ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν ποιεῖσθαι they asked whether they should deliver their city
  to the Corinthians, and should try.., [Refs 5th c.BC+] —in both constructions the
  _indicative_ or subjunctive may be retained, ψῆφον ἐβούλοντο ἐπαγαγεῖν εἰ χρὴ πολεμεῖν[Refs];

  them or should dispose of them in some other way, [Refs]; ἀνακοινοῦσθαι αὐτὸν αὑτῷ

  __C.5 the NEG. used with εἰ in indirect questions is οὐ, when οὐ would be used in
  the direct question, ἐνετέλλετο.. εἰρωτᾶν εἰ οὔ τι ἐπαισχύνεται whether he is not
  ashamed, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but if μή would be required in the direct form, it is
  retained in the indirect, οὐ τοῦτο ἐρωτῶ, ἀλλ᾽ εἰ τοῦ μὲν δικαίου μὴ ἀξιοῖ πλέον
  ἔχειν μηδὲ βούλεται ὁ δίκαιος, τοῦ δὲ ἀδίκου (the direct question would be μὴ ἀξιοῖ
  μηδὲ βούλετα; he does not see fit nor wish, does he?) [Refs 5th c.BC+]:—in double
  indirect questions, εἴτε.. εἴτε..; εἰ.. εἴτε..; εἴτε.. ἢ.., either οὐ or μή can
  be used in the second clause, ὅπως ἴδῃς εἴτ᾽ ἔνδον εἴτ᾽ οὐκ ἔνδον [Refs 5th c.BC+];
