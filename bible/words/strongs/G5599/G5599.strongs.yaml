etymology: 'ὦ

  and ὤ, an exclamation, expressing surprise, joy, or pain, O! oh! with nominative,
  ὢ τάλας ἐγώ [Refs 5th c.BC+]: also with genitive, ὢ τῆς ἀναισχυντίας [Refs 2nd c.AD+];
  with interrogative, ὤ, τί λέγει; [Refs]; in the middle of a sentence, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __II with vocative, a mode of address, whether at the beginning of a sentence or
  in a parenthesis, ὦ Ἀχιλεῦ [Refs 8th c.BC+]; in invocations of the gods, ὦ Ζεῦ τε
  καὶ Γῆ καὶ πολισσοῦχοι θεοί [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὦ πρὸς θεῶν ὕπεικε [Refs 4th c.BC+]:
  sometimes following the Verb, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in different number from the vocative,
  προσέλθετ᾽, ὦ παῖ, πατρί [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 with nominative instead of vocative, ὦ δῐος αἰθήρ, ὦ φίλος, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  also οὗτος, ὦ σέ τοι (i.e. καλῶ) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.3 with both together, φίλος ὦ Μενέλαε [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.4 with the latter of two nouns, Ἀγάμεμνον, ὦ Μενέλαε [Refs].—In the first sense
  usually written ὤ, in the second ὦ: [τὸ ὢ] ἡνίκα θαυμαστικὸν λαμβάνεται βαρύνεται,
  καὶ χωρεῐ εἰς ἐπιρρηματικὴν σύνταξιν, οἷον ὢ Ἡρακλῆς [Refs] (ὦ,) expresses surprise
  (but [Refs 2nd c.AD+] seems to imply ὦ in both senses); ὤ as an exclamation is found
  in forms like{ὤ μοι}, ὤ μοι ἐγώ, ὢ πρὸς τῶν θεῶν [Refs 4th c.BC+] is improbable,compare
  [Refs 9th c.AD+]; ᾤμοι and ὤμοι are both recognized by [Refs 7th c.BC+]; written
  ὼ ώ in Papyrus of [Refs 5th c.BC+]. To those who (like [Refs 2nd c.BC+] for the
  vocative of the Article ὁ, [Refs 2nd c.AD+] replies at length. {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
