etymology: 'νῦν

  (for νυν, νυ, see infr. II), adverb now, both of the present moment, and of the
  present time generally, οἳ ν. βροτοί εἰσιν mortals of our day, [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  so in Ionic dialect and Attic dialect, οἱ ν. [ἄνθρωποι] men of the present day,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὁ ν. τρόπος, τὸ ν. βαρβαρικόν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Βοιωτοὶ οἱ ν.[Refs
  5th c.BC+]the present, [LXX+5th c.BC+]; μέχρι ν. (variant{μ. τοῦ ν}.) [Refs 1st
  c.BC+]; τὰ ν. simply, ={ν}., [NT+5th c.BC+]

  __2 of the immediate past, just now, but now, ν. Μενέλαος ἐνίκησεν [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __3 of the future, presently, ν. αὖτ᾽ ἐγχείῃ πειρήσομαι [Refs 8th c.BC+]; compare
  νῦν δή, νυνί.

  __4 sometimes opposed to to what might have been under other circumstances, as it
  is (or was), as the case stands (or stood), as a matter offact, ν. δ᾽ ὁ μὲν ὣς ἀπόλωλε
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; καὶ ν. even so, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __5 coupled with other Particles, τὰ ν. γε [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ν. δή, see entry :
  with other expressions of Time, ν... σήμερον, ν. ἡμέρη ἥδε, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ν.
  ἤδη henceforth, [Refs 5th c.BC+] (anapaest meter), etc.; ν... ἄρτι but now, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __II enclitic (but see below) νυν, νυ. [νυ only Epic dialect, Boeotian dialect,
  and [Refs 4th c.AD+]; νῠν twice in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ῠ [Refs 5th c.BC+], ῡ in Comedy
  texts [Refs 5th c.BC+]; both quantities in τοίνυν, which see]

  __II.1 rarely of Time, now, perhaps so used in [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.2 in Epic dialect mostly as a particle of emphasis, ἧκε δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ Ἀργείοισι κακὸν
  βέλος· οἱ δέ νυ λαοὶ θνῇσκον [Refs 8th c.BC+]: frequently coupled with other Particles
  or Conjs., ἦ ῥά ν. [Refs]; ἐπεί νύ τοι[Refs]

  __II.3 in commands or entreaties, μή ν. μοι νεμεσήσετ᾽ [Refs] come now ![Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; so in Boeotian dialect, ν. ἔνθω [Refs 5th c.AD+]

  __II.4 in questions, τίς ν.; τί ν.; who, what, why now? [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἦ νυ..;
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; oxytone when ={δή}, Tyrannioap.Hdn.Gr.2.27; καθ᾽ ὁμαλισμόν or
  κατ᾽ ἔγκλισιν when=δή, [Refs 5th c.BC+]. In codices usually perispomenon in both
  senses, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; even νῠν is written νῦν in codices vett. [Refs 5th c.BC+]
  passim, also in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; hence νυν may frequently be restored where the
  sense requires it. The accent of τοίνῡ?~Xν perhaps shows that both νῠν and νῡν could
  be enclitic.—Position: in signf. I νῦν can occupy any position; in signf. II it
  prefers (like other enclitics, but also like{ἄν, δέ, γάρ}, etc.) the second place
  in the sentence, e.g. πρός νύν σε πατρός [Refs 5th c.BC+]; νυ (always enclitic)
  precedes other enclitics and allows only δέ to precede.] (Cf. Sanskrit nú, n[umacracute],
  nūnám, O[Refs 5th c.BC+] nū ''now'', etc.) {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
