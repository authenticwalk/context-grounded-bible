  § Darius = "lord"

  1) Darius the Mede, the son of Ahasuerus, king of the Chaldeans, who succeeded to
  the Babylonian kingdom on the death of Belshazzar; probably the same as "Astyages"
  the last king of the Medes (538 BC)

  2) Darius, the son of Hystaspes, the founder of the Perso-Arian dynasty (521 BC)

  3) Darius II or Darius III

  3a) Darius II, Nothus (Ochus) was king of Persia during the time of Nehemiah (424/3-405/4
  BC). Darius II is the most probable because he is mentioned by Nehemiah and ruled
  during the time of Nehemiah

  3b) Darius III, Codomannus was king of Persia during its last years at the time
  of Alexander the Great and was his opponent (336-330 BC) {STEPBible-TBESH}'
