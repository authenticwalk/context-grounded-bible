etymology: 'γε,

  Doric dialect and Boeotian dialect γα, enclitic Particle, giving emphasis to the
  word or words which it follows.

  __I with single words, at least, at any rate, but often only to be rendered by italics
  in writing, or emphasis in pronunciation: τὸ γὰρ.. σιδήρου γε κράτος ἐστίν such
  is the power of iron, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; εἴ που πτωχῶν γε θεοὶ.. εἰσίν if the poor
  have any gods to care for them,[Refs]; ὅ γ᾽ ἐνθάδε λεώς at any rate the people here,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] not even two, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὔκουν φθόγγος γε not the least
  sound, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.2 with Pronouns: with pronoun of 1st pers. [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τουτογί, ταυταγί,
  etc., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὅσον γε χρῄζεις even as much as..,[Refs 5th c.BC+]: rarely
  with interrogative Pronouns, τίνα γε.. εἶπας ;[Refs 5th c.BC+]; ποίου γε τούτου
  πλήν γ᾽ Ὀδυσσέως ἐρεῖς ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.3 after Conjunctions, to emphasize the modification or condition introduced
  by the subjoined clause, πρίν γε, before at least, sometimes repeated, οὐ μὲν..
  ὀΐω πρίν γ᾽ ἀποπαύσεσθαι, πρίν γε.. αἵματος ἆσαι Ἀρῆα [Refs 8th c.BC+]; πρὶν ἄν
  γε or πρίν γ᾽ ἄν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴ γε, ἐάν γε, if that is to say, if really,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also simply to lay stress on the condition, κἄν γε μὴ λέγω and
  if I do not.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴπερ γε if at any rate, [Refs 5th c.BC+], etc.;
  ὥστε γε (variant{ὥς γε}), with infinitive, so far at least as to.., [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ὥς γε or ὥσπερ γε as at least, [Refs 5th c.BC+]:—γε may follow τε, when τε is closely
  attached to the preceding word, ὡς οἷόν τέ γε μάλιστα [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.4 after other Particles, καὶ μὴν.. γε, οὐ μὴν.. γε, with words intervening,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; after ἄν in apodosi, when preceded by οὐ or καί, [Refs]; ἄταρ..
  γε but yet, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καίτοι γε, see at {καί το; ἀλλά γε} (without intervening
  words) is falsa lectio in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἀλλά γε δή uncertain in [Refs 1st c.AD+]

  __I.5 when preceding other Particles, γε commonly refers to the preceding word,
  while the Particle retains its own force: but sometimes modifies the sense of the
  following Particle, γε μήν nevertheless, πάντως γε μήν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Epic dialect
  and Ionic dialect γε μέν [Refs 8th c.BC+] frequently strengthens an assertion, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; γέ τοι, implying that the assertion is the least that one can say, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; γέ που at all events, any how, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; for γε οὖν, see at
  {γοῦν}.

  __II exercising an influence over the whole clause:

  __II.1 epexegetic, namely, that is, Διός γε διδόντος that is if God grant it, [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; κλῦθι, Ποσείδαον.., εἰ ἐτεόν γε σός εἰμι if indeed I am really thine,
  [Refs] any man—at least any wise man, [Refs]; frequently preceded by καί, usually
  with words intervening, ἦ μὴν κελεύσω κἀπιθωΰξω γε πρός ay and besides that.., [Refs
  4th c.BC+]; παρῆσάν τινες καὶ πολλοί γε some, ay and a great many, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  frequently with the last term in an enumeration, ταύτῃ ἄρα.. πρακτέον καὶ γυμναστέον
  καὶ ἐδεστέον γε καὶ ποτέον [LXX]; rarely without intervening words, καί γε ὁ θάνατος
  διὰ τὴν μοίρην ἔλαχεν [NT+5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 in dialogue, in answers where something is added to the statement of the
  previous speaker, as ἔπεμψέ τίς σοι.. κρέα; Answ. καλῶς γε ποιῶν yes and quite right
  too, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; κενὸν τόδ᾽ ἄγγος, ἢ στέγει τι; Answ. σά γ᾽ ἔνδυτα.. yes indeed,
  your clothes, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὕτω γὰρ ἂν μάλιστα δηχθείη πόσις. Answ. σὺ δ᾽ ἂν
  γένοιο γ᾽ ἀθλιωτάτη γυνή yes truly, and you.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; πάνυ γε yes certainly,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὕτω γέ πως yes somehowso, [Refs]; sometimes preceded by καί,
  καὶ οὐδέν γ᾽ ἄτοπον yes and no wonder, [Refs]; sometimes ironically, εὖ γε κηδεύεις
  πόλιν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.3 to heighten a contrast or opposition,

  __II.3.a after conditional clauses, εἰ μὲν δὴ σύ γ᾽.., τῷ κε Ποσειδάων γε.. if you
  do so, then at all events Poseidon will.., [Refs 8th c.BC+] {γέα}; ἐπεὶ πρὸς τοῦτο
  σιωπᾶν ἥδιόν σοι.. τόδε γε εἰπέ at any rate tell me this, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.3.b in disjunctive sentences to emphasize an alternative, ἤτοι κεῖνόν γε..
  δεῖ ἀπόλλυσθαι ἢ σέ.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]: also in the second clause, εἰπέ μοι, ἠὲ
  ἑκὼν ὑποδάμνασαι ἤ σέ γε λαοὶ ἐχθαίρουσι [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.4 in exclamations, etc., ὥς γε μή ποτ᾽ ὤφελον λαβεῖν uncertain in [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; in oaths, οὔτοι μὰ τὴν Δήμητρά γ᾽ variant in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; merely in
  strong assertions, τίς ἂν φιλέοντι μάχοιτ; ἄφρων δὴ κεῖνός γέ.. [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.5 implying concession, εἶμί γε well then I will go (in apodosi), [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __III γε frequently repeated in protasis and apodosis, as πρίν γε.., πρίν γε, see[Refs
  5th c.BC+]; even in the same clause, οὐδέν γ᾽ ἄλλο πλήν γε καρκίνους [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __IV POSITION: γε normally follows the word which it limits; but is frequently placed
  immediately after the Article, as ὅ γε πόλεμος [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or the preposition,
  κατά γε τὸν σὸν λόγον [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ δέ γε[Refs]; frequently in retorts, ἁμές
  ποκ᾽ ἦμες ἄλκιμοι νεανίαι. Answ. ἁμὲς δέ γ᾽ εἰμές [Refs]; οὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὅτι λέγεις. Answ.
  ἡ γραῦς δέ γε οἶδ᾽, ὡς ἐγῷμαι [Refs 4th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
