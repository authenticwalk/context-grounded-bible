lemma: γάρ
transliteration: gár
definition: properly, assigning a reason (used in argument, explanation or intensification;
  often with other particles)
kjv_usage: and, as, because (that), but, even, for, indeed, no doubt, seeing, then,
  therefore, verily, what, why, yet
derivation: a primary particle;
extended_definition: 'γάρ,

  co-ordinating particle, contr. of γε ἄρα,

  verily then, hence, in truth, indeed, yea, then, why, and when giving a reason or
  explanation, for, the usage in NT being in general accord with that of cl.;

  __1. explicative and epexegetic: Mat.4:18 19:12, Mrk.1:16 5:42 16:4, Luk.11:3o,
  Rom.7:1, 1Co.16:5, al.

  __2. Conclusive, in questions, answers and exclamations: Mat.9:5 27:23, Luk.9:25
  22:27, Jhn.9:30, Act.8:31 16:37 19:35, Rom.15:26, 1Co.9:10, Php.1:18 (Ellic., in
  l.), 1Th.2:20, al.

  __3. Causal: Mat.1:21 2:2, 5, 6, 3:23, Mrk.1:22, 9:6, Luk.1:15, 18, Jhn.2:25, Act.2:25,
  Rom.1:9, 11, 1Co.11:5, Rev.1:3, al.; giving the reason for a command or prohibition,
  Mat.2:20 3:9, Rom.13:11, Col.3:3, 1Th.4:3, al.; where the cause is contained in
  an interrog. statement, Luk.22:27, Rom.3:3 4:3, 1Co.10:29; καὶ γάρ, for also, Mrk.10:45,
  Luk.6:32, 1Co.5:7, al. id. as in cl. = etenim, where the καί loses its connective
  force (Bl., §78, 6; Kühner 3, ii, 854f.), Mrk.14:70, Luk.1:66 22:37, 2Co.13:4. The
  proper place of γάρ is after the first word in a clause, but in poets it often comes
  third or fourth, and so in late prose: 2Co.1:19. Yet "not the number but the nature
  of the word after which it stands is the point to be noticed" (see Thayer, see word).
