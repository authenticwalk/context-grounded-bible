etymology: 'ἀντί,

  preposition governing genitive:—originally sense, over against. (Cf. Sanskrit  ánti
  ''opposite'', ''facing'', Latin ante, etc.)

  __A USAGE:

  __A.I of Place, opposite, over against, formerly quoted from several places of [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; so ἄντ᾽ Αἴαντος (i.e. ἄντα)[Refs 8th c.BC+]; but ἀντί is so used in
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]c-l68; αἱ ὀπαὶ αἱ γιγνόμεναι ἀ. τόρμων mortises facing tenons, [Refs
  2nd c.BC+]; ἀντὶ μαιτύρων in the presence of witnesses, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A.II of Time, ἀντὶ νυκτός the same night, [Refs]; ἀντὶ ϝέτεος[Refs 1st c.BC+];
  ἀνθ᾽ ἡμέρας· δι᾽ ὅλης τῆς ἡμέρας, [Refs 5th c.AD+]; compare ἀντετοῦς.

  __A.III instead, in the place of, Ἕκτορος ἀντὶ πεφάσθαι[Refs 8th c.BC+]: sometimes
  used elliptically, ἦ ''τολμήσατ᾽ ἀντ᾽ ἐμοῦ δοῦναί τιν; i.e. ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐμοὶ δοῦναι,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2 in [Refs 8th c.BC+] he is as good as many men, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἀντὶ
  κασιγνήτου ξεῖνος.. τέτυκται a guest is as much as a brother, [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ἀντί τοί εἰμ᾽ ἱκέταο I am as a suppliant, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; so later τοῦτό σφι ἀντὶ
  λουτροῦ ἐστί serves as a bath, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὑπάρχειν ἀντὶ τῶν ἔνδον to be as
  hostages for.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; δουλεύειν ἀντὶ ἀργυρωνήτων just like bought slaves,
  [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A.III.3 to denote exchange, at the price of, in return for, σοὶ δὲ θεοὶ τῶνδ᾽
  ἀντὶ χάριν.. δοῖεν[Refs 8th c.BC+]; νῆσον ἀντὶ χρημάτων παρέλαβον for money paid,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; δοίην ἀντ᾽ ἀνιῶν ἀνίας grief for grief, [Refs 6th c.BC+]:—hence
  ἀνθ᾽ ὧν wherefore, [NT+5th c.BC+]; ἀντὶ τούτου therefore, [NT]; but ἀνθ᾽ ὧν also
  for ἀντὶ τούτων ὄτι.., because, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἀντὶ το; wherefore? why? [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; also ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ὅτι ἦτε.. instead of being as you were.., [LXX]

  __A.III.4 for the sake of, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; with Verbs of entreaty, like{πρός}
  with genitive, ἀντὶ παίδων ἱκετεύομέν σε[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.5 to mark comparison, ἓν ἀνθ᾽ ἑνός one set against the other, compared with
  it, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος, i.e. ever-increasing grace, [NT]; in preference
  to, ἀφνεὸν βούλεται ἀντ᾽ ἀγαθοῦ[Refs 6th c.BC+]: even after Comparatives, πλέον
  ἀντὶ σοῦ[Refs 5th c.BC+]; so (especially after a negative) ἄλλος ἀντ᾽ ἐμοῦ[Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __B POSITION: ἀντί rarely follows its case, as in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; but the Grammars  hold
  that it never suffers anastrophe.

  __C IN COMPOSITION (joined with other words), it signified,

  __C.1 over against, opposite, as ἀντιβαίνω, ἀντίπορος.

  __C.2 against, in opposition to, as ἀντιλέγω, ἀντίβιος.

  __C.3 one against another, mutually, as ἀντιδεξιόομαι.

  __C.4 in return, as ἀντιβοηθέω.

  __C.5 instead of, as ἀντιβασιλεύς, ἀνθύπατος.

  __C.6 equal to, like, as ἀντίθεος, ἀντίπαις, ἀντίδουλος.

  __C.7 corresponding, counter, as ἀντίφορτος, ἀντίτυπος. {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
