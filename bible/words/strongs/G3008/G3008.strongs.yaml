extended_definition: 'λειτουργέω, -ῶ

  (λειτουργός), [in LXX chiefly for שָׁרַת pi., also for עָבַד, צָבָא, etc. ;]

  __1. in cl., at Athens, to supply public offices at one''s own cost, render public
  service to the State, hence, generally,

  __2. to serve the State, do a service, serve (of service to the Gods, Diod., i,
  21): of the official service of priests and Levites (Exo.29:30, Num.16:9, Sir.4:14,
  1Ma.10:42, al.; cf. Deiss., BS, 140 f.), Heb.10:11; of Christians: with dative of
  person(s) before ἐν, Rom.15:27 (cf. Sir.10:25); τ. κυρίῳ, Act.13:2.†

  SYN.: λατρεύω (which see), prop., to serve for hire, LXX (as some­times in cl.),
  always of service to the deity on the part of both priests and people (Exo.4:3,
  Deu.10:12, and similarly in NT). λειτουργέω "is the fulfilment of an office: it
  has a definite representative character, and corresponds with a function to be discharged".
  It is therefore used of serving in an office or ministry: in LXX always of priests
  and Levites, in NT, with its cognates (Rom.13:6 15:27, are not really exceptions),
  of services rendered either to God or man by apostles, prophets, teachers, and other
  officers of the church (cf. Tr., Syn., § xxxv; ICC on Rom.1:9; Westc., He., 232
  ff.)  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
