  SYN.: ἐρωτάω, which see, πυνθάνομαι. On the proper distinction between these words,
  see Tr., Syn., § xl, Thayer, see word αἰ. In late Gk., however, αἰ. and ἐ. seem
  to have become practically synonymous (cf. Act.3:2,3; see Field, Notes, 101 f.;
  M, Th., I, 4:1; M, Pr., 66.n; MM, VGT, see word). (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
