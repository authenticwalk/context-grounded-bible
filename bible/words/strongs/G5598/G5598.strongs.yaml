etymology: 'Ω, ὦ, τό,

  twenty-fourth and last letter of the Ionic alphabet, ἀπὸ ἄλφα ἕως.ω. [Refs 9th c.AD+];
  thence used as a symbol of the end, the last, ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ ἄλφα καὶ τὸ ὦ (not τὸ
  ὦ μέγα) [NT]:—as a numeral ώ =  800, but ωνυμ = 800, 000. The epichoric _Attic dialect_
  and other alphabets of the Inscrr. had used o in differently to represent the sounds
  of the later ο and ω: Ω is a differentiated form of ο, and, though usually = ω,
  was used in the Ionic islands of Paros, Thasos, and Siphnos with the value ο, while
  O or O represented the sound ω. The name of the letter was τὸ ὦ (perispomenon accusative
  to [Refs 5th c.BC+]: after the loss of the distinction between long and short vowels,
  ο and ω had the same pronunciation; they begin to be confused in Papyri of [Refs
  3rd c.BC+](οἰκωνόμου [Refs 3rd c.BC+], but the name ω μέγα appears first in later
  Greek, [Refs 9th c.AD+]; ἐν τῷ ω ¯ μεγάλῳ under omega (in a lexicon), [Refs 2nd
  c.AD+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
