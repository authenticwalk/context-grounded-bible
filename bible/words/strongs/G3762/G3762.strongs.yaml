etymology: 'οὐδείς,

  feminine οὐδεμίᾰ (never nominative accusative -μίη, -μίην, since οὐδεμιῇ is probably
  in [Refs], rarely οὐδ᾽ ἴα [Refs 7th c.BC+], not one, i.e. no one, none, used by
  [Refs 8th c.BC+], except in the phrase τὸ ὃν μένος οὐδενὶ εἴκων [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  οὐδείς is found in [Refs 5th c.BC+]: rare in plural, no set of persons or things,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδένων εἰσὶ βελτίους, i.e. οὔ τινων ἄλλων, [Refs 5th c.BC+] —In
  _Ionic dialect_ the _plural_ is usually οὐδαμοί.

  __2 οὐ. ὅστις οὐ every one, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδὲν ὅ τι οὐ every, [Refs]; this
  came to be regarded as one word, so that οὐδείς passed into the same case as ὅστις,
  οὐδένα ὅντινα οὐ κατέκλασε [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __3 later οὐδὲν ὅ τι without οὐ, = nothing, οὐδὲν ὅ τι παρήσω [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __4 ὅστις οὐδείς not one, ἐτεθνήκεσαν δὲ αὐτῶν μὲν ἀμφὶ τοὺς τετρακοσίους, Ρωμαίων
  δὲ ὅστις οὐδείς [Refs]

  __II naught, good for naught, ὦ νῦν μὲν οὐ. αὔριον δ᾽ ὑπέρμεγας [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  τὸ μὲν [γένος ἀνδρῶν] οὐδέν [Refs 5th c.BC+] knowing naught, [Refs 6th c.BC+]; οὐκ
  ἄρ᾽ ᾔστην οὐδὲν ἄλλο πλὴν δάκνειν knew nothing save how to.., [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  οὐδὲν λέγειν to say naught, see at {λέγω} (B) III.6 ; τὸ οὐδ᾽ οὐδέν the absolute
  nothing, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 in neuter, of persons, οὐδέν εἰμι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.3 in plural, οὐδένες ἐόντες ἐν οὐδαμοῖσι ἐοῦσι Ἕλλησι being nobodies, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; ὁ μηδὲν ὢν κἀξ οὐδένων κεκλήσομαι uncertain conjecture in [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __II.4 with Preps., παρ᾽ οὐδὲν εἶναι [Refs]; παρ᾽ οὐδὲν ἄγειν, θέσθαι, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __II.5 τὸ οὐδέν naught, zero, in Arith., [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; used by Democritus as
  a name for Place, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __III neuter οὐδέν as adverb, not at all, naught, ἄριστον Ἀχαιῶν οὐ. ἔτισεν [Refs
  8th c.BC+]: in answers, nothing, never mind, no matter, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδέν
  γε not at all, [Refs]; οὐδὲν μᾶλλον, οὐδὲν ἧσσον, οὐδὲν ὕστερος, see at {μάλα} [Refs
  4th c.BC+]

  __III.2 οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἤ, see at {ἄλλος} III. 2.

  __B REMARKS: the more emphatic and literal sense, not even one, i.e. none whatever,
  belongs to the full form, οὐδὲ εἷς, οὐδὲ μία, οὐδὲ ἕν, which is never elided, even
  in Comedy texts (see. [Refs 5th c.BC+], but frequently has a Particle inserted between,[Refs
  5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
