  Epic dialect and Ionic dialect τέο [Refs 8th c.BC+]; Trag. and Attic dialect τοῦ
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Ionic dialect, Trag., and Attic dialect τίνος [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  dative Ionic dialect τέῳ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; no dative in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; Trag.
  and Attic dialect τῷ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Aeolic dialect τίῳ [Refs 7th c.BC+]; τίνι
  first in [NT+8th c.BC+]; genitive Epic dialect τέων [Refs 8th c.BC+], and as monosyllable
  [Refs]; Trag. and Attic dialect τίνων [Refs 5th c.BC+]; dative τίσι first in [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; Ionic dialect τέοισι [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Aeolic dialect τίοισι [Refs 7th
  c.BC+]; Boeotian dialect τά [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Megarian dialect σά [Refs 5th c.BC+]:
  of the plural [Refs 8th c.BC+] with genitive τέω; ποῖος (what? which?) is sometimes
  preferred (especially in neuter plural) to the adjective τίς, e.g. τὰ ποῖα ταῦτα
  χρήματ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I in direct questions, who? which? neuter what? which? ὦ ξεῖνοι, τίνες ἐστ;
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τίς ἀχώ, τίς ὀδμὰ προσέπτα μ᾽ ἀφεγγή; [Refs 4th c.BC+]; properly
  at the beginning of the sentence; but this position may be varied,

  __B.I.a for grammatical reasons, as between the Article and participle or noun,
  τοὺς τί ποιοῦντας τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο ἀποκαλοῦσι; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τῆς περὶ τί πειθοῦς
  ἡ ῥητορική ἐστιν τέχν; [Refs]; ὁ σοφιστὴς τῶν τί σοφῶν ἐστι; [Refs]

  __B.I.b for emphasis, ἃ δ᾽ ἐννέπεις, κλύουσα τοῦ λέγει; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; πόλις

  with the genitive singular, of all genders, πρὸς τί χρεία; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἐλπίδων
  ἐς τ; [Refs]

  __B.I.2 sometimes as the predicate, τίς ὀνομάζετα; what is he named? [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  so also may be explained the union of τίς with a demonstrative or possessive pronoun,
  or with a Noun preceded by the Article, τί τοῦτ᾽ ἔλεξα; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τί ἐστι
  τουτ; τίς ὁ τρόπος τοῦ τάγματο; [Refs]; also with pronoun in plural, τί ταῦτ; [Refs

  ἠδικῆσθα; [Refs]; τί με τὸ δεινὸν ἐργάσ; what is the dreadful thing which.. ? [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τίν᾽ ὄψιν σὴν προσδέρκομα; what face is this I see of thine? [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; παρὰ τίνας τοὺς ὑμᾶ; who are ''you'' to whom [I am to come]? [Refs 5th c.BC+]
  —the _Article_ is exceptionally added to τίς, when it leads up to a word which requires
  the Article, ληφθήσει.. Πανήμου εἰκάδι· καὶ Λῴου τῇ--τίν; τῇ δεκάτῃ on the twentieth
  of the month Panemus and of Loüs on the --what day? the tenth, [Refs 3rd c.BC+]
  —in Comedy texts also τὸ τί; what is that? [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τοῦ τίνος χάρι; [Refs

  __B.I.4 τίς ἂν θεῶν.. δοί; like{πῶς ἄν}, would that some one.. , [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.5 a question with τίς often amounts to a strong negation, τῶν δ᾽ ἄλλων τίς
  κεν οὐνόματ᾽ εἴπο; [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τίς ἂν ἐξεύροι ποτ᾽ ἄμεινο; [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  τίνες ἂν δικαιότερον.. μισοῖντ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.6 sometimes two questions are asked in one clause by different cases of τί;
  ἡ τίσιν τί ἀποδιδοῦσα τέχνη δικαιοσύνη ἂν καλοῖτ; [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.I.7 τίς with Particles:—τίς γά; why who? who possibly? τίς γάρ σε θεῶν.. ἧκε;
