  (see. below), imperfect ἐκαθεζόμην in Prose, [Refs 5th c.BC+] (but frequently as
  aorist 2, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in Poets, καθεζόμην [Refs 8th c.BC+]: future καθεδοῦμαι
  [LXX+5th c.BC+]: aorist καθεσθείς [Refs 2nd c.AD+], which supplies the transitive
  sense, is more common in present and imperfect, but we have κατ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἕζεαι [Refs
  8th c.BC+]:—sit down, take one''s seat, ἀγορήνδε καθεζώμεσθα κιόντες [Refs 8th c.BC+];

  ἐν.. εὐνατηρίοις [Refs 5th c.BC+]; preside, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ λαχόντες προεδρεύειν,
  ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ παρασκευῆς καθεζόμενοι taking their seats, [Refs 5th c.BC+]
