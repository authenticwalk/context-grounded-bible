  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'οὐ,

  the negative of fact and statement, as μή of will and thought; οὐ denies, μή rejects;
  οὐ is absolute, μή relative; οὐ objective, μή subjective. —The same differences
  hold for all compounds of οὐ and μή, and some examples of οὐδέ and οὐδείς are included
  below.—As to the Form, see infr. G. USAG[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I as the negative of single words,

  __II as the negative of the sentence.

  __I οὐ adhering to single words so as to form a quasi-compound with them:—with Verbs:
  οὐ δίδωμι withhold, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐκ εἰῶ prevent, [Refs]; οὐκ ἐθέλω refuse,
  [Refs]; οὔ φημι deny, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; but sometimes οὐ is retained, εἰ δ᾽ ἂν..
  οὐκ ἐθέλωσιν [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἐάντε.. οὐ (variant{μή}) φῆτε ἐάντε φῆτε [Refs 8th
  c.BC+] —On the use of οὐ in contrasts, see below [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II as negativing the whole sentence,

  __II.1 οὐ is frequently used alone, sometimes with the ellipsis of a definite Verb,
  οὔκ (i.e. ἀποκερῇ), ἄν γε ἐμοὶ πείθῃ [Refs 5th c.BC+]: sometimes as negativing the
  preceding sentence, [Refs 5th c.BC+] and the accusative; sometimes without μά, οὐ
  τὸν πάντων θεῶν θεὸν πρόμον Ἅλιον [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 with indicative of statement, τὴν δ᾽ ἐγὼ οὐ λύσω [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐ φθίνει
  Κροίσου φιλόφρων ἀρετά [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.3 with subjunctive in future sense, only in Epic dialect, οὐ γάρ τίς με βίῃ
  γε ἑκὼν ἀέκοντα δίηται [Refs]

  __II.4 with optative in potential sense (without ἄν or κεν), also Epic dialect,
  ὃ οὐ δύο γ᾽ ἄνδρε φέροιεν [Refs]

  __II.5 with optative and ἄν, κείνοισι δ᾽ ἂν οὔ τις.. μαχέοιτο [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.6 in dependent clauses οὐ is used,

  __II.6.a with ὅτι or ὡς, after Verbs of saying, knowing, and showing, ἐκ μέν τοι
  ἐρέω.. ὡς ἐγὼ οὔ τι ἑκὼν κατερύκομαι [Refs 8th c.BC+]: so with indicative or optative
  and ἄν, ἀπελογοῦντο ὡς οὐκ ἄν ποτε οὕτω μωροὶ ἦσαν [Refs 5th c.BC+] in such sentences,
  see at {μή} [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.6.b in all causal sentences, and in temporal and Relat. sentences unless there
  is conditional or final meaning, χωσαμένη, ὅ οἱ οὔ τι θαλύσια.. ῥέξε [Refs 8th c.BC+]:
  in causal relative sentences, οἵτινές σε οὐχὶ ἐσώσαμεν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; especially
  in the combinations, οὐκ ἔστιν ὅστις οὐ.., as οὐκ ἔστ᾽ ἐραστὴς ὅστις οὐκ ἀεὶ φιλεῖ
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδείς ἐστιν ὅστις οὐ.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.6.c after ὥστε with indicative or optative with ἄν, ὥστ᾽ οὐ δυνατόν σ᾽ εἵργειν
  ἔσται [Refs 5th c.BC+]infinitive is almost invariably due to indirect speech, ὥστ᾽
  οὐκ αἰσχύνεσθαι (for οὐκ αἰσχύνονται) [Refs 5th c.BC+]—Rarely not in indirect speech,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.7 in a conditional clause μή is necessary, except,

  __II.7.a in [Refs 8th c.BC+] clause precedes the apodosis and the verb is indicative,
  εἰ δέ μοι οὐκ ἐπέεσσ᾽ ἐπιπείσεται [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.7.b when the εἰ clause is really causal, as after Verbs expressing surprise
  or emotion, μὴ θαυμάσῃς, εἰ πολλὰ τῶν εἰρημένων οὐ πρέπει σοι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.7.c when οὐ belongs closely to the next word (see. [Refs 4th c.BC+], or is
  quoted unchanged, εἰ, ὡς νῦν φήσει, οὐ παρεσκευάσατο [Refs 4th c.BC+]; εἰ δ᾽ οὐκέτ᾽
  ἐστί (i.e. ὥσπερ λέγεις), τίνι τρόπῳ διεφθάρη ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.8 οὐ is used with infinitive in indirect speech, when it represents the indicative
  of orat. recta, φαμὲν δέ οἱ οὐ τελέεσθαι [Refs 8th c.BC+]; sometimes we have οὐ
  and μή in consecutive clauses, οἶμαι σοῦ κάκιον οὐδὲν ἂν τούτων κρατύνειν μηδ᾽ ἐπιθύνειν
  χερί [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.9 οὐ is used with the participle, when it can be resolved into a finite sentence
  with οὐ, as after Verbs of knowing and showing, τὸν κατθανόνθ᾽ ὁρῶντες οὐ τιμώμενον
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or into a causal sentence, τῶν βαρβάρων οἱ πολλοὶ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ
  διεφθάρησαν νέειν οὐκ ἐπιστάμενοι [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or into a concessive sentence,
  δόξω γυναῖκα καίπερ οὐκ ἔχων ἔχειν [Refs 5th c.BC+] and participle, ὡς οὐχὶ συνδράσουσα
  νουθετεῖς τάδε [Refs 5th c.BC+]:—for exceptions, see at {μή} [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.9.b when the participle is used with the Article, μή is generally used, unless
  there is a distinct reference to a fact, when οὐ is occasionally found, ἡμεῖς δὲ
  ἀπὸ τῆς οὐκ οὔσης ἔτι [πόλεως] ὁρμώμενοι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.10 Adjectives and abstract Substantives with the article commonly take μή (see.
  μή [Refs 5th c.BC+] is occasionally used, τὰς οὐκ ἀναγκαίας πόσεις [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  τὴν τῶν γεφυρῶν οὐ διάλυσιν the non- dissolution of the bridges, the fact of their
  notbeing broken up, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so without the article, ἐν οὐ καιπῷ [Refs]

  __II.11 for οὐ μή, see entry

  __II.12 in questions οὐ ordinarily expects a positive answer, οὔ νυ καὶ ἄλλοι ἔασι..;
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐχ ὁράᾳς..; dost thou not see? [NT+8th c.BC+]: the diphthong
  is genuine and always written ου (ουκ, ουδε, etc.) in early Inscrr., [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  οὐ abbreviated ο, Suid. see at {Φιλοξένου γραμμάτιον}.

  __H ACCENTUATION. οὐ is oxytone accusative to Hdn.Gr.1.494 (text doubtfulin 504):
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __H.I οὐ in connexion with other Particles will be found in alphabetical order,
  οὐ γάρ, οὐ μή, etc.—The corresponding forms of μή should be compared. {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
