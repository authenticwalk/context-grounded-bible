  (ὁμός, θυμός), [in LXX for יַחַד (frequently in Jb), Wis.10:20 18:5, 12, al. ;]

  with one mind, with one accord: Act.1:14 2:46 4:24 5:12 7:57 8:6 12:20 15:25 18:12
  19:29, Rom.15:6 (Hatch, Essays, 63 f., argues that the un-cl. sense together, which
  is found in Job.3:18 38:33, Num.24:24, Wis.18:5, 12 (but not Wis.10:20), al., should
  be attached to the NT instances, but see Abbott, Essays, 96; MM, xviii).†
