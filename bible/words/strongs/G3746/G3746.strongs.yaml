etymology: 'ὅσπερ, ἥπερ, ὅπερ

  (Epic dialect ὅπερ as masculine, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; genitive οὗπερ, Epic dialect
  οἷόπερ [Refs 3rd c.BC+]; in Ionic dialect writers and in Poets the oblative cases
  are sometimes borrowed from the Article, τόπερ [Refs 8th c.BC+]; on concord and
  construction [Refs 5th c.BC+],3, IV. 4:—the very man who, the very thing which;
  frequently indistinguishable from simple ὅς,[Refs] and περ, ὅς ῥ᾽ ἔβαλέν περ [Refs
  8th c.BC+]

  __2 used after adjectives of resemblance, ὡυτὸς ὅσπερ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὅμοια ἔπραττον
  ἅπερ ἄν.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὅρκια τάπερ τε.. the same as.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II special uses of cases,

  __II.1 ὅπερ, wherefore, [Refs 1st c.BC+]; although, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __II.2 ἅπερ, as, like, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare καθάπερ.

  __II.3 οὗπερ, see at {ὅς} A b. [Refs]

  __II.4 ᾗπερ, Doric dialect ᾇπερ, which way, where, whither, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; Ionic
  dialect τῇπερ, ἔθαψαν.. τῇπερ ἔπεσε [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also, as, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.5 in the Logic of Aristotle, ὅπερ ἐστί, or ὅπερ alone, has two senses:

  __II.5.a non-technical, and unemphatic, what (a thing) is, ἑκάστη οὐσία τοῦθ᾽ ὅ.
  ἐστίν, οὐ λέγεται μᾶλλον καὶ ἧττον each substance is called what it is without the
  difference of more or less, [Refs]; τὸ διπλάσιον τοῦθ᾽ ὅ. ἐστίν, ἑτέρου λέγεται
  the double is called what it is (i.e.  the double) of something, i.e. is relative,
  [Refs]

  __II.5.b expressing identity, οὔτε ἡ χιὼν ὅ. λευκόν snow is not what white is, i.e.
  is not identical with white, [Refs]; ὁ λευκὸς ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔστιν ὅ. χρῶμα [Refs]precise
  or essential nature of a thing, οὐ γὰρ ἂν φαίη ὅ. κακόν τι εἶναι τὴν ἡδονήν he would
  not say that pleasure is essentially something bad, [Refs]; τὰ μὲν οὐσίαν σημαίνοντα
  ὅ. ἐκεῖνό ἢ ὅ. ἐκεῖνό τι σημαίνει expressions which show the essence show precisely
  what the thing in question is or precisely of what kind it is (i.e. indicate either
  its species or its genus), [Refs]; ὅ. [τόδε] τί ἐστι τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι the essence
  of a thing is precisely a ''this'', i.e. a fully specified particular, [Refs]; ἡ
  μὲν [ἐπιστήμη] ὅ. ἀνθρώπου ἐστίν knowledge (that man is an animal) is apprehension
  that ''animal'' is an element in the essential nature of man, [Refs] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
