  in Ionic dialect μέχρι is preferred (see. above): but ἄχρι, -ις are more common
  in [Refs 8th c.BC+] before both consonants and vowels,[Refs 2nd c.AD+]; and so in
  Attic dialect Inscrr. (where it is somewhat less frequently than μέχρι): ἄχρι ἄν
  with hiatus in [Refs 4th c.BC+] —Never in Trag. (ἄχρι, ={ṃṃ-χρι}, compare μέχρι.)
