  μῆνα.., οὐδὲν δὲ κωλύει κἂν τ. [Refs]; τ. τῆς ὑποσχέσεως sooner than they had promised,
  [Refs]; τ. τοῦ παραγγέλματος [Refs 1st c.AD+]; formerly, ἐπεσκεύασαν τὸ παρόχιον,..

  __C.II.2 the usual form is τάχιστος, η, ον, used by [Refs 8th c.BC+] as adverb,
  most quickly, most speedily, ὅττι τάχιστα as soon as may be, as soon as possible,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; so ὅσον τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ᾳ (probably) τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ὅπως τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὡς τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]: these are elliptically phrases,
  as may be seen from the following examples, ὡς δυνατόν ἐστι τάχιστα [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ᾗ δυνατὸν τ. [Refs]; ὡς or ᾗ ἠδύνατο τ. [Refs]; ὡς δύναιτο τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ὡς or ᾗ ἂν δύνωμαι τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  τε) τάχιστα [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἐπειδὴ τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἐπεὰν τ. [Refs 5th c.BC+];
