  __B.I Relat. to ὥς or οὕτως (like ὡς), in such manner as, as:

  __B.I.1 with the ordinary Constr. of the Relat.:

  __B.I.1.a with indicative, ἦ τοι νόστον, ὅπως φρεσὶ σῇσι μενοινᾷς, ὥς τοι Ζεὺς τελέσειεν
  [Refs 8th c.BC+] adverb, με τοῖον ἔθηκεν, ὅπως (for οἷον)[Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὅ. ἔχω
  as I am, on the spot, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.1.b with future indicative, especially after Verbs of seeing, providing, taking
  care.., in the manner in which, how, that, οἱ Περσικοὶ νόμοι ἐπιμέλονται ὅπως μὴ
  τοιοῦτοι ἔσονται οἱ πολῖται [Refs 5th c.BC+]: this future indicative may become
  optative after a historical tense, ἐπεμελεῖτο ὅπως μήτε ἄσιτοι μήτε ἄποτοί ποτε
  ἔσοιντο [Refs 5th c.BC+]; and ὅπως is frequently used interchangeably with such
  forms as δι᾽ ὧν, ὅτῳ τρόπῳ, etc., εἰσηγοῦνται μὴ δι᾽ ὧν.. ἀσκήσουσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως..
  δόξουσι [Refs 5th c.BC+]: this sense easily passes into a final sense, so that,
  τοῦτο ἀπόβαλε οὕτω ὅκως μηκέτι ἥξει [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὕτω δ᾽ (i.e. ποίει) ὅπως
  μήτηρ σε μὴ ''πιγνώσεται [Refs 5th c.BC+]; see below [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  in a gnomic statement, εἰκῇ κράτιστον ζῆν ὅ. δύναιτό τις [Refs 5th c.BC+] however
  one might think fit to call it, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B.I.3 a very common phrase is οὐκ ἔστιν ὅ. (οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ὅπως) there is no way in
  which.., it cannot be that, οὐκ ἔστι ὅκως κοτὲ σοὺς δέξονται λόγους [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  so οὐκ ἔστιν ὅ. οὐ, fieri non potest quin, οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ὅ. οὐ πιστὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν πτερὸν
  ἐξήγαγ᾽ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδαμῶς ὅ. οὐ, in answer, it must positively be so, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; οὐ γὰρ γένοιτ᾽ ἄν, ταῦθ᾽ ὅ. οὐχ ὧδ᾽ ἔχειν (anacoluthon for ἔχει or ἕξει)
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἔστιν οὖν ὅ. ὁ τοιοῦτος φιλοσοφήσε; [Refs 5th c.BC+] may be followed

  δρῦν ὑλοτόμοι σχίζουσι κάρα [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so in Locrian dialect Prose, ὅπω(σ)ξένον

  __B.I.5 like{ὡς} or ὅτι, with superlative of Advs., ὅ. ἄριστα [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  ὅ. ἀνωτάτω as high up as possible, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in full, οὕτως ὅ. ἥδιστα (i.e.
  ἔχει) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.6 with a genitive added, σοῦσθε ὅ. ποδῶν run as you are off for feet, i. e.
  as quick as you can, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.I.7 sometimes of Time, when, Τρῶες.. ὅπως ἴδον αἷμ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος.., ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ πάντες
  ἔβησαν [Refs 8th c.BC+] with optative, whenever, ὅκως μὲν εἴη ἐν τῇ γῇ καρπὸς ἁδρός

  in Attic dialect, θαυμάζω ὅ. ποτὲ ἐπείσθησαν Ἀθηναῖοι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2 οὐχ ὅ... ἀλλὰ or ἀλλὰ καὶ.. is not only not.. but.., and is explained by
  an ellipsis of λέγω or ἐρῶ (compare ὅτι IV), οὐχ ὅ. κωλυταὶ.. γενήσεσθε, ἀλλὰ καὶ..
  δύναμιν προσλαβεῖν περιόψεσθε not only will you not become.., but you will also..,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] do not think that you could dance = so far from being able to dance,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2.b οὐχ ὅ. rarely follows another clause, to say nothing of.., let alone..,
  πεπαύμεθ᾽ ἡμεῖς, οὐχ ὅ. σε παύσομεν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; μηδ᾽ ἐμπίδα, οὐχ ὅπως ταῦρον
  ἔτι ἄρασθαι δυνάμενος.. let alone a bull, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  without difference of meaning, ἐπράττετο γὰρ.., πρῶτον μὲν ὅπως μὴ περιμείνητε..,
  δεύτερον δὲ ὅπως ψηφιε̄σθε.., τρίτον δὲ ὅπως μὴ ἔσται [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III.3 with optative after tenses of past time, τῶν ἀδῄλων ὅπως ἀποβήσοιτο [Refs
  8th c.BC+]

  __B.III.4 with optative and ἄν frequently expressing a wish, which in direct speech
  would be expressed by πῶς ἄν, σκόπει ὅ. ἂν ἀποθάνοιμεν ἀνδρικώτατα [Refs 5th c.BC+]
  and subjunctive sometimes appear in consecutive clauses, [Refs]

  __B.III.5 ὅπως ἄν (κεν) with the subjunctive is used after imperative or infinitive
  used as imperative, πείρα ὅπως κεν δὴ σὴν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἵκηαι [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.III.7 after Verbs of fear and caution, ὅπως and ὅπως μή are used with future

  the preceding Verb is omitted, ὅπως μὴ οὐκ.. ἔσομαι [Refs]

  rarely with present, οὐ φοβεῖ ὅ. μὴ ἀνόσιον πρᾶγμα τυγχάνῃς πράττων [Refs 5th c.BC+]:
  sometimes the preceding Verb is omitted, with aorist subjunctive, ὅκως μή τι ὑμῖν

  = the imperative, ἔμβα χὤπως ἀρεῖς [Refs]future indicative, ὅκως λόγον δώσεις τῶν
  μετεχείρισας χρημάτων, ={δίδου λόγον}, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὅπως παρέσει μοι, ={πάρισθι},
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]: rarely with I person, ὁποῖα κισσὸς δρυός, ὅπως τῆσδ᾽ ἕξομαι [Refs
  5th c.BC+]: very rarely with aorist subjunctive, ὅπως μή τι ἡμᾶς σφήλῃ [Refs 5th
  c.BC+] —The codices frequently vary, as between διδάξεις and -ξῃς [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  τιμωρήσονται and -ωνται[Refs 5th c.BC+]; θορυβήσει and -σῃ[Refs 4th c.BC+] —Since
  the future is frequently, and the aorist (whether 1 or 2) rarely guaranteed by metre
  or form, the aorist 1 forms should probably be rejected, both in signification 7
  and 8, in cases where codices vary.

  __B.2 with optative after historical tenses, πὰρ δέ οἱ αὐτὸς ἔστη, ὅπως.. κῆρας
