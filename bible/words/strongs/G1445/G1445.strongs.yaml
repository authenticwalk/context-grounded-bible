  a Hebrew.

  __1. In OT, of Israelites in contrast with those of another race (Gen.14:13, Exo.1:15,
  Deu.15:12, al.).

  __2. In NT as the correlative of Ἑλληνιστής, a Jew who had adopted, in greater or
  less degree, Greek culture and Greek language. The distinction was not merely linguistic
  (DB, ii, 325); as far as it was so, Συριστής would be a more correct Greek term
  for the Jew of Semitic speech (see: Ἑβραΐς, and cf. Dalman, Words, 7): Act.6:1,
  2Co.11:22, Php.3:5.
