etymology: 'ἄρᾰ,

  Epic dialect ῥά (which is enclitic and used after monosyllables, ἦ, ὅς, γάρ, etc.,
  or words ending in a vowel or diphthong, e.g. ἐπεί), before a consonant ἄρ (perhaps
  cf. Lithuanian i[rtilde] ''and''): expressing consequence, then, or mere succession,
  there and then, and in many derived uses.

  __A EARLIER USAGE: to denote,

  __A.I immediate transition, there and then, straightway, ὣς φάτο βῆ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ Ὄνειρος[Refs
  8th c.BC+]: after a participle, ὣς εἰπὼν κατ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἕζετο[Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὕτως ἄρα[Refs
  5th c.BC+]; often in apodosi, as αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ θηήσατο.. αὐτίκ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἤλυθεν[Refs
  8th c.BC+]: in enumerations, e. g. in Homer''s catalogue, then, next, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽
  Ἀθήνας εἶχον[Refs]; so in genealogies, Σίσυφος.. ὁ δ᾽ ἄ. Γλαῦκον τέκεθ᾽ υἱόν[Refs]

  __A.I.2 to draw attention, mark you! τὸν τρεῖς μὲν ἐπιρρήσσεσκον.. τῶν ἄλλων Ἀχιλεὺς
  δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐπιρρήσσεσκε καὶ οἶος[Refs]: to point a moral or general statement, φευγόντων
  δ᾽ οὔτ᾽ ἂρ κλέος ὄρνυται οὔτε τις ἀλκή[Refs]

  __A.II connexion, such as,

  __A.II.1 that of antecedent and consequent, οἰνοχόει.. ἄσβεστος δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐνῶρτο γέλως[Refs]:
  also in questions, τίς τ᾽ ἄρ τῶν ὄχ᾽ ἄριστος ἔη; who then (say you) was.. ? [Refs]he
  it was, whom.., [Refs], thus, then he spoke.—This usage is universal in Greek.

  __A.II.2 explanation of that which precedes, χωόμενον κατὰ θυμὸν ἐϋζώνοιο γυναικὸς
  τήν ῥα.. ἀπηύρων whom (and for this cause he was angry) they had taken away, [Refs];
  εἰ μὴ ὑπερφίαλον ἔπος ἔκβαλε.. φῆ ῥ᾽ ἀέκητι θεῶν φυγέειν for he said, [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; so with relatives, ἐκ δ᾽ ἔθορε κλῆρος ὃν ἄρ᾽ ἤθελον αὐτοί the very one which..,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B LATER USAGE, always with inferential force: 1. in drawing conclusions (more
  subjective than οὖν), ἄριστον ἄ. ἡ εὐδαιμονία[Refs 4th c.BC+]: especially by way
  of informal inference, as it seems, οὐκ ἄ. σοί γε πατὴρ ἦν Πηλεύς[Refs 8th c.BC+];
  οὕτω κοινόν τι ἄ. χαρᾷ καὶ λύπῃ δάκρυά ἐστιν so true is it that.., [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  so in announcing the discovery or correction of an error, as οὐκ ἐννενοήκαμεν ὅτι
  εἰσὶν ἄ... [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἰκότως ἄ. οὐκ ἐγίγνετο· ὡς γὰρ ἐγὼ νῦν πυνθάνομαι..
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.2 in questions, expressing the anxiety of the questioner, τίς ἄ. ῥύσετα; who
  is there to save ? [Refs 4th c.BC+]; so in exclamations to heighten the expression
  of emotion, οἵαν ἄρ᾽ ἥβην.. ἀπώλεσεν what a band of youth was that.. ! [Refs]; so
  ὡς ἄρα[Refs 5th c.BC+]; πῶς ἄ.; οὕτως ἄ., etc.; ἄ. alone, ἔζης ἄ.[Refs 5th c.BC+]:
  especially in ironical comments, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.3 epexegetic, namely, ἐρῶ, ὡς ἄ... [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.4 for τοι ἄρα, τἄρα, see entry τοι [Refs]

  __B.5 εἰ (or ἐάν) μὴ ἄ. unless perhaps, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; separated from εἰ μή,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.6 in hypothetical clauses, to indicate the improbability of the supposition,
  ἢν ἄ. ποτὲ κατὰ γῆν βιασθῶσιν[Refs 5th c.BC+]; or simply, perhaps (sometimes separated
  from εἰ), εἴ τις οὖν ὑμῶν ἄ... ὑπελάμβανεν[Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C IN CRASIS, frequently τἄρα, μεντἄρα, οὐτἄρα: also δήξομἄρα for δήξομαι ἄ., [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; οἰμώξετἄρα, κλαύσἄρα, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __D ἄρα never stands first in the sentence in Classical Greek [Refs 4th c.BC+],
  but is found at the beginning of an apodosis in [NT], and first in a sentence, [NT+2nd
  c.AD+]; in conclusion of syllogism, [Refs 2nd c.AD+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
