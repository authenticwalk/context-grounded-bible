strongs_number: G4441
language: greek
lemma: πυνθάνομαι
transliteration: pynthánomai
definition: to question, i.e. ascertain by inquiry (as a matter of information merely;
  and thus differing from G2065 (ἐρωτάω), which properly means a request as a favor;
  and from G154 (αἰτέω), which is strictly a demand for something due; as well as
  from G2212 (ζητέω), which implies a search for something hidden; and from G1189
  (δέομαι), which involves the idea of urgent need); by implication, to learn (by
  casual intelligence)
kjv_usage: ask, demand, enquire, understand
derivation: middle voice prolonged from a primary (which occurs only as an alternate
  in certain tenses);
extended_definition: 'πυνθώ᾽ομαι
