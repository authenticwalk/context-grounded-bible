  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'Included with:  εἴσω,

  ἔσω, used by Epic dialect, Lyric poetry, and Trag. Poets accusative as a spondee
  or iambus is required; ἔσω (as ἐς for εἰς) prevailed in Ionic dialect and old Attic
  dialect Prose; but in other Prose and in Comedy texts εἴσω was the only form admitted,
  whereas ἔσωθεν with the comparative and superlative ἐσώτερος, ἐσώτατος, ἐσωτέρω,
  ἐσωτάτω, seem to have been the only forms in use:— adverb of εἰς, ἐς, to within,
  into: absolutely, μή πού τις ἐπαγγείιῃσι καὶ εἴσω lest some one may carry the news
  into the house, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; also εἴσω δ᾽ ἀσπίδ᾽ ἔαξε he brake it through to
  the inside, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; πέπληγμαι..ἔσω[Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἡγεῖσθαι εἴσω, φεύγειν
  εἴσω, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __b when a case follows, [Refs 8th c.BC+] prefers the accusative, δῦναι δόμον Ἄϊδος
  εἴσω [Refs 8th c.BC+]; more rarely with genitive, κατελθόντ᾽ Ἄϊδος εἴσω [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; so in Prose and Trag., Κύκλωπος ἔσω βλεφάρων ὤσας [Refs 5th c.BC+]; it generally
  follows its case, but precedes in [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __2 with Verbs of Rest, ={ἔνδον}, inside, within, εἴσω δόρπον ἐκόσμει [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; τὸ ἔσω μέτωπον the inner front, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __2.b with genitive, μένειν εἴσω δόμων [Refs 4th c.BC+]; γλῶσσαν εἴσω πυλῶν ῥέουσαν[Refs
  5th c.BC+]; εἴσω ξίφους within reach of sword, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴσω τῶν ὅπλων
  within the heavy-armed troops, i.e. encircled by them, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴσω τῶν
  ὀρέων within, i.e. on this side of, the mountains, [Refs]; ἔσω τούτων inside of
  these people, i.e. farther inland, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴσω βέλους within bow-shot,
  [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; τὰ δένδρα τῆς ὁδοῦ ποιεῖν εἴσω, i.e. inside, i.e. by the side
  of, the road, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __II later of Time, within, εἴσω ἡμερῶν εἴκοσι [Refs 5th c.BC+]
