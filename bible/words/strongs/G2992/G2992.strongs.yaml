etymology: 'λᾱός, ὁ,

  Ionic dialect ληός [Refs 6th c.BC+] (variant{λαόν}, which is in all Mss. in [Refs
  6th c.BC+]; Attic dialect λεώς, which is also used in [Refs 5th c.BC+] and in late
  Prose, as Foed.Byzantine cited in [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __1 in [Refs 8th c.BC+] (λαοί) usually means men, i.e. soldiers, both of the whole
  army and smaller divisions, κριτὸς ἔγρετο λ. Ἀχαιῶν [Refs]; periphrastic, στρατὸς
  λαῶν[Refs]; mostly including both foot and horse, as [Refs]; but sometimes λαός
  denotes foot, as opposed to horse, [Refs]; also, a land army, opposed to a fleet,
  [Refs]; also, the common men, opposed to their leaders, [Refs]; but

  __2 in [Refs 8th c.BC+], almost always means men or people; as subjects of a prince,
  e.g. [Refs 8th c.BC+]; λαοὶ ἀγροιῶται country-folk, [Refs]; work-people, [Refs];
  of sailors, [Refs 8th c.BC+] seafaring folk, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: in singular, slave,
  τὸν Εὐρυσθέως λεών, of Heracles, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; and so perhaps λεὼς αὔτοικος
  [Refs], i.e. mankind, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; λ. ἐγχώριοι the natives,[Refs 8th c.BC+];
  especially in Egypt, of the fellahin, [Refs 3rd c.BC+]; civil population, opposed
  to priests and soldiers, [Refs 3rd c.BC+]

  __3 people assembled, as in the theatre, ὁ πολὺς λαῶν ὄχλος [Refs 5th c.BC+]; especially
  in the Ecclesia, αἱ στίχες τῶν λαῶν [Refs] hear O people!—the usual way of beginning
  proclamations at Athens, like our [Refs 6th c.BC+]; τιμῶσιν οἱ πάντες λεῴ[Refs 4th
  c.BC+]; ὁ πολὺς λεώς the multitude, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __4 in LXX, of the people, as opposed to priests and Levites, [NT]; of [NT]

  __II a people, i.e. all who are called by one name, first in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἱππόται
  λαοί, i.e. the Thessalians, [Refs 5th c.BC+] people and λᾶος stone (compare λᾶας)
  is implied in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; and so [Refs 5th c.BC+] explains the word from the
  legend of Deucalion, [Refs 5th c.BC+] (From λᾱϝ-, as shown by the proper noun  Λαϝοπτόλεμος
