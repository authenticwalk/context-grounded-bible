  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'ὅς, ἥ, ὅ,

  genitive οὗ, ἧς, οὗ, etc.; dative plural οἷς, αἷς, οἷς, etc.: Epic dialect forms,
  genitive ὅου (probably replacing Οο) in the phrases ὅου κλέος οὔ ποτ᾽ ὀλεῖται [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; feminine ἕης [Refs 8th c.BC+]; elsewhere only ἧς [Refs]; dative plural
  οἷς, οἷσι, ᾗς, ᾗσι (never αἷς or αἷσι in [Refs 8th c.BC+] — _pronoun_ used,

  __A  as demonstrative by the side of οὗτος, ὅδε, and the Article ὁ, ἡ, τό: in post-Homeric
  Gr. this use survived only in a few special phrases.

  __B  as a Relat. by the side of the Article ὅ, ἥ, τό (see. ὁ, ἡ, τό, c):—this demonstrative
  and Relat. pronoun must not be confounded with the Possess. ὅς, ἥ, ὅν. (With Gr.
  Relat. ὅς, ἥ, ὅ cf. Sanskrit Relat. yas, yā, yad, Lithuanian jis, ji (he, she),
  Oslav. i, ja, je (he, she, it).)

  __A DEMONSTR. PRON., ={οὗτος},{ὅδε}, this, that; also, he, she, it:

  __A.I Homeric usage: this form only occurs in the nominative masculine and neuter
  ὅς, ὅ, and perhaps nominative feminine ἥ and nominative plural οἵ, the other cases
  being supplied by ὁ, ἡ, τό (ὅ, ἡ, τό); most codices have ἥ in [Refs 8th c.BC+] before
  it, μηδ᾽ ὅν τινα γαστέρι μήτηρ κοῦρον ἐόντα φέροι, μηδ᾽ ὃς φύγοι [Refs 8th c.BC+]participle,
  εἰς ἕτερον γάρ τίς τε ἰδών.., ὃς σπεύδει (for ὅστις ἂν ἴδῃ, ὃς σπεύδει) [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]

  __A.II in later Gr. this usage remained in a few forms:

  __A.II.1 at the beginning of a clause, καὶ ὅς and he, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καὶ ἥ and
  she, καὶ οἵ and they, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.2 ὃς καὶ ὅς such and such a person, [Refs 5th c.BC+] —here also the _Article_
  supplied the oblative cases.

  __A.II.3 ἦ δ᾽ ὅς, ἦ δ᾽ ἥ, said he, said she, see at {ἠμί}.

  __A.II.4 in oppositions, where it sometimes answers to the Article, Λέριοι κακοί·
  οὐχ ὁ μέν, ὃς δ᾽ οὔ.. [Refs 6th c.BC+]; ὃ μὲν.., ὃ δὲ.., ὃ δὲ.. (neuter) [NT+4th
  c.BC+]: so in Doric dialect dative feminine as adverb, ᾇ μὲν.., ᾇ δὲ.. [Refs 4th
  c.BC+]: very frequently in late Prose, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]: also answering to other
  Prons., ἑτέρων.., ὧν δὲ.. [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B RELAT. PRON., who, which.—By the side of the simple Relat., ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (in [Refs
  8th c.BC+]

  __A0USAGE of the Relat. pronoun (the following remarks apply to ὅς γε, ὅσπερ, ὅστε,
  ὅστις, as well as to ὅς, and to ὁ, ἡ, τό as relative):

  __A0.I in respect of CONCOR[Refs 4th c.BC+] —Prop. it agrees in gender and number
  with the Noun or _pronoun_ in the antecedent clause.—But this rule admits of many
  exceptions:

  __A0.I.1 the Relat. mayagree with the gender implied, not expressed, in the antecedent,
  φίλον θάλος, ὃν τέκον αὐτή [Refs 8th c.BC+]: so after collective Nouns, the Relat.
  is frequently put in plural in the gender implied in the Noun, λαόν.., οὕς.. [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; στρατιάν.. τοιαύτην.., οἵ τινες.., τὸ ναυτικόν, οἵ.., [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  especially after the names of countries or cities, Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην ἀφίκανεν,
  οἳ.. (i. e. to Telepylos of the Laestrygonians, who.. ) [Refs 8th c.BC+] adjective,
  Θηβαίας ἐπισκοποῦντ᾽ ἀγυιάς, τάν.. the streets of Thebes, which.., [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  τοὺς Ἡρακλείους παῖδας, ὃς.. the children of Heracles, who.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]of
  me whom.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸν ἥμισύν ἐστ᾽ ἀτελὴς τοῦ χρόνου· εἶθ᾽ ἧς πᾶσι μέτεστι..,
  where ἧς agrees with ἀτελείας implied in ἀτελής, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A0.I.2 when the antec. Noun in singular implies a class, the Relat. is sometimes
  in plural, ἦ μάλα τις θεὸς ἔνδον, οἳ.. ἔχουσιν (for τις θεῶν, οἵ..) in some places,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὗ μέν.., οὗ δέ.. in some places.., in others.., [Refs 4th c.BC+]
  in what part of the earth, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A0.I.2 in pregnant phrases, μικρὸν προϊόντες..,οὗ ἡ μάχη ἐγένετο (for ἐκεῖσε οὗ)
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἀπιὼν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, οὗ κατέφυγε (for οἷ κατέφυγε καὶ οὗ ἦν) [NT+5th
  c.BC+]: but in early writers this is falsa lectio, as in [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A0.II dative feminine ᾗ, Doric dialect ᾇ, of Place, where, or Manner, as, see
  at {ᾗ}.

  __A0.III old locative οἷ, as adverb, see at {οἷ}.

  __A0.III.2 old ablative (?) ὧ, in Doric dialect (compare ϝοίκω), τηνῶθε καθεῖλον,
  ὧ (whence) μ᾽ ἐκέλευ καθελεῖν τυ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A0.IV accusative singular neuter ὅ, very frequently ={ὅτι}, that, how that, λεύσσετε
  γὰρ τό γε πάντες ὅ μοι γέρας ἔρχεται ἄλλῃ [Refs 8th c.BC+]; and so also, because,
  ταρβήσας ὅ οἱ ἄγχι πάγη βέλος [Refs]

  __A0.IV.2 in Attic dialect ὅ, for which reason, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A0.IV.3 whereas, [NT+5th c.BC+]

  __A0.V ἀφ᾽ οὗπερ from the time that.., [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A0.VI ἐφ᾽ ᾧ, see at {ἐπί} [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
