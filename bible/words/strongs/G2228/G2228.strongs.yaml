  [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.II.1.b without an introductory Particle, θεός νύ τις ἦ βροτός ἐσσ; art thou
  a goddess or a mortal? [Refs 8th c.BC+] frequently in codices of [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ἄρτι δὲ ἥκεις ἢ πάλα; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; preceded by πότερον, πότερον δοκεῖ σοι κάκιον
  εἶναι, τὸ ἀδικεῖν ἢ τὸ ἀδικεῖσθα; [Refs]

  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.4 ἢ οὐ is used when a negative precedes, οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον ἐπ᾽ ἡμέας ἢ οὐ καὶ
  ἐπ᾽ ὑμέας [Refs 5th c.BC+]: after an implied negative, ὠμὸν.. πόλιν ὅλην διαφθεῖραι
  μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ τοὺς αἰτίους [Refs]

  __B.5 frequently omitted with numerals after πλείων, ἐλάττων, μείων, ἔτη.. πλείω
  ἑβδομήκοντα variant in [Refs 5th c.BC+]: sometimes with an infinitive or conditional
