etymology: 'βρύκω

  or βρύχω [ῡ] (the former Attic dialect accusative to [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; the distinction
  βρύκω bite, βρύχω gnash does not hold good), mostly present: future βρύξω [Refs
  5th c.BC+]: aorist ἔβρυξα [Refs 5th c.BC+]: aorist 2 ἔβρῠχε [Refs], see at {βρυχάομαι}:
  —passive, see below:—eat greedily, gobble, γνάθος ἱππείη βρύκει champs the bit,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; bite, βρύκουσ᾽ ἀπέδεσθαι.. τοὺς δακτύλους biting, [Refs]; of smoke,
  ὀδὰξ ἔβρυκε τὰς λήμας ἐμοῦ [Refs]; later, simply, devour, consume, [Refs 2nd c.BC+];
  βρύξας, of the sea, is perhaps falsa lectio for{βρόξας} in [Refs 1st c.BC+]: metaphorically,
  tear in pieces, devour, of a gnawing disease, βρύκει [Refs 5th c.BC+]:—passive,
  ἀπόλωλα, τέκνον, βρύκομαι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II gnash or grind the teeth, τοὺς ὀδόντας βρύχει [NT+5th c.BC+]; also βρύχει alone,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also intransitive, οἱ ὀδόντες βρύχουσι[Refs 2nd c.BC+]:—middle,
  βρύχονται [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
