  5th c.BC+]: so with accusative of things, to fear to do it, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: with
  participle, σ. προσορῶν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __2 after [Refs 8th c.BC+], with accusative person, revere, worship, Κρονίδαν [Refs

  __2.b especially of Jewish proselytes, σεβομένη τὸν θεόν [NT+1st c.AD+]; σεβόμενοι
  προσήλυτοι, Ἕλληνες, [NT]

  __3 of things, τὰ βυβλία σεβόμενοι μεγάλως [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II active σέβω is post-[Refs 8th c.BC+], used only in present and imperfect, worship,
  honour, mostly of the gods, σ. Δήμητρος πανήγυριν [Refs 7th c.BC+]; τἀν Ἅιδου[Refs];
  rare in Prose, νομίζεται θεοὺς σέβειν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but also of parents, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; of kings, [Refs]; of suppliants, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; σέβειν ἐν τιμῇ with
  accusative, [Refs 5th c.BC+]infinitive, ὑβρίζειν ἐν κακοῖσιν οὐ σέβω, i.e. τὸ ὑβρίζειν,

  __II.2 less frequently absolutely, to worship, to be religious, τὸν σέβοντ᾽ εὐεργετεῖν
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but in all these places an object should perhaps be supplied from
  the context. (σέβομαι probably originally ''I shrink from.. '', of which σοβέω is
  the causal; perhaps cognate with Sanskrit tyajati ''desert, let go''.) {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
