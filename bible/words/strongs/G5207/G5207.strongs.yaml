  __2. Metaphorical;

  __(a) as belonging to, being connected with or having the quality of that which

  Act.13:10; τ. νυμφῶνος (see: νυμφών), Mat.9:15, Mrk.2:19, al.; τ. φωτός (Lft., Notes,

  __(b) υἱὸς τ. θεοῦ (cf. Dalman, Words, 268ff.; Deiss., BS, 166f.; DB, iv, 570 ff.;
  DCG, ii, 654ff.), of men, as partakers of the Divine nature and of the life to come:
  Mat.5:9, Luk.20:36, Rom.8:14 9:26, al.; υἱοὶ (κ. θυγατέρες) τ. ὑψίστου, Luk.6:35,
  2Co.6:18; in an unique sense of Jesus, Mat.4:3 8:29 28:19, Mrk.3:4, Luk.4:41, Jhn.9:35
  11:27, al.; ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱ. τ. θεοῦ ζῶντος (τ. εὐλογητοῦ), Mat.16:16, Mrk.14:61;

  __(with) (ὁ) υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (in LXX for Heb. בּן אדם, Aram, בּר אנשׁ; cf. Dalman,
  Words, 234ff.; DB, iv, 579ff.; DCG, ii, 659ff.; Westc., St. John, i, 74ff.; other
  reff. in Swete, Mk, 2:10), based on the Aram. of Dan.7:13, where the phrase, like
  the corresponding Heb. (as in Psa.8:5), means a man, one of the species, and indicates
  the human appearance of the person in question. It is used of the Messiah in Enoch,
  with 46, §1-4, also in II Est.13:3, 12, al. Our Lord first makes the phrase a title,
  using the def. art. It seems to combine the ideas of his true humanity and representative
  character. Exc. in Act.7:56 and (anarth.) Rev.1:13 14:14, it is used of Jesus only
  by himself: Mat.8:20, Mrk.2:10, Luk.5:24, Jhn.1:52, al.

etymology: 'υἱός, ὁ

  (written ϝηιός in Ἀρχ. Ἐφ. [Refs 6th c.BC+] —in earlier _Attic dialect_ and other
  Inscrr. inflected as a ῠ-stem (like πῆχυς), _nominative_ υἱύς (written huihus)[Refs];
  dative υἱεῖ: dual υἱεῖ [Refs 5th c.BC+], written ηυιε in [Refs 5th c.BC+] are rejected
  by [Refs 2nd c.AD+], Thom.Mag.p.367 R., as not Attic dialect, though the two latter
  forms are used by later writers (as υἱέα [Refs 3rd c.BC+] is falsa lectio in [Refs
  5th c.BC+] is mentioned as a form that would be regular by [Refs] —Homer uses _nominative_
  υἱός (very frequently); genitive υἱοῦ only in [Refs 8th c.BC+], elsewhere υἱέο;
  dative υἱέϊ or υἱε; accusative υἱέα [Refs 8th c.BC+]: plural, nominative υἱέες [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; dative υἱοῖσι (ν) only [Refs 8th c.BC+], belongs solely to later Epic
  dialect poets, as [Refs 3rd c.BC+] (υιυις lapis); accusative υἱύν [Refs]; genitive
  υἱέος [Refs 6th c.BC+]; but υἱοῦ [Refs 7th c.BC+]; nominative plural υἱέες [Refs];
  accusative plural υἱύνς [Refs 8th c.BC+] which have ρα = ṛ, cf. Sanskrit pitṛ[snull]u);
  ὑέεσσι [Refs]; υἷος in [Refs 5th c.BC+] is nominative rather than genitive in [Refs
  2nd c.BC+]; a nominative ὑϊς (scanned - ?~X) [Refs 6th c.BC+]-in Attic dialect Inscrr.
  down to [Refs 5th c.BC+] reappears under the Empire; in Plato codex A usually has
  ὑιος, which is found also in T, codex B always has υἱός, editors restore ὑό; accusative
  υἱόν is recommended by [Refs 2nd c.AD+] [same place]; in Inscrr. of Pergamon, Magnesia,
  and Delphi, and in non-literary Papyri, ὑός is at all times less common than υἱός:—ὁ
  υεἱός [Refs]:—son, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; υἱὸν ποιεῖσθαί τινα to adopt as a son, [Refs
  4th c.BC+]; υἱεῖς ἄνδρες grown-up sons, [Refs 4th c.BC+] Oracle texts cited in [Refs
  5th c.BC+]: rarely of animals, [NT]

  __2 periphrastic, υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, for Ἀχαιοί, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __3 generally, child, and so υἱ. ἄρρην male child, [NT+3rd c.AD+]

  __4 frequently in [Refs] years old, [LXX]; υἱοὶ ἀδικίας [Refs]hostages, [LXX+NT]

  __5 in some dialects, including the Ionic dialect Prose of [Refs 5th c.BC+] is rare
  in Trag., [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __6 as a general term of affection, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; υἱέ, an author''s address
  to the reader, [LXX]

  __7 δάμου υἱός, υἱὸς πόλεως, Ἑλλάδος, as titles of honour, [Refs 1st c.AD+]

  __8 υἱοὶ ἀνθρώπων sons of men, periphrastic for men (compare above 2,4), [LXX];
  οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀ.[LXX+NT]man, [LXX]; of the Messiah,[LXX+NT]; used by Jesus of himself,
  [NT] (by Stephen recalling the words of Jesus, [NT]

  __9 υἱοὶ Θεοῦ sons of God, implying inheritors of the nature of God [NT]; implying
  participants in the glory of God, [Refs]

  Θεοῦ, [NT]

  __9.c Θεοῦ υἱός, = Latin [Refs] filius, patronymic of Augustus, [Refs 4th c.BC+].
  [Hom.sometimes has the first syllable short in nominative, vocative and accusative
  singular, οὐδὲ Δρύαντος υἱός [Refs 8th c.BC+]; Simon. [prev. cited] seems to have
  used a monosyllable nominative υἷς, and Hdn.Gr. may have read it as ὕις (??), but
  this is uncertain, as in [Refs 8th c.BC+] does not occur.] (Prob. from *sū-yú-s,
  cf. Sanskrit sūte ''procreate'', Tocharian (A-dialogue) se, (B-dialogue) soyä ''son'';
  different suffix in *sū-nu-s, Sanskrit sūnūs, etc., and in *s[ucaron]-nu-s, O[Refs
  5th c.BC+] sunu, etc. (all = son); *sūyú- perhaps became *s[ucaron]wyú-, then *suiwú-;
  υἱός and υἱόν perhaps by dissimilation from υἱύς υἱύν, since the o-stem forms appear
  first where υ-υ would otherwise be repeated; ὗϊς (ὑΐς) may be another dissimilation;
  the precise origin of υἷος υἷι υἷες etc. is uncertain.) {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
