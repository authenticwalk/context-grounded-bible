  Wis.4:1 5:13 8:7 2:1-24; 4Mac.2.2 * ;]

  prop., whatever procures pre-eminent estimation for a person or thing, in Hom. any

  goodness, virtue;

  __(b) of men: Php.4:8, 2Pe.1:5; pl. (Isa, Es, ll. with), excellencies: 1Pe.2:9 (the
  usage appears to be a survival of an early comprehensive sense in which the original
