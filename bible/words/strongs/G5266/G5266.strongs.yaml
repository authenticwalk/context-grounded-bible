  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; whereas ὑπόδημα κοῖλον is a shoe or half-boot, which covered the
  whole foot (see. κοῖλος 1.1); ὑπόδημα is sometimes used alone in this sense,[Refs
  5th c.BC+]; εἰς ὑποδήματα γράφειν put down as paid for shoes, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  δεξιὸν εἰς ὑ., ἀριστερὸν εἰς ποδάνιπτρα, of one who is ready for anything, perhaps
  alluding to Theramenes (see. κόθορνος 3)[Refs 5th c.BC+]; similar words are ascribed
  to [Refs 4th c.BC+].ιά (where ὑπόδησις is used); τὸ ὑ. ἔρραψας μὲν σύ, ὑπεδήσατο
  δὲ Ἀρισταγόρης [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
