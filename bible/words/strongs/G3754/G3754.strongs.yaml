  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'ὅτῐ,

  Epic dialect ὅττῐ (both in [Refs 8th c.BC+]: conjunction, to introduce an objective
  clause, that, after Verbs of seeing or knowing, thinking or saying; in [Refs 8th
  c.BC+] —Usage:

  __I when ὅτι introduces a statement of fact:

  __I.a in [Refs 8th c.BC+] always with indicative, the tense following the same rules
  as in English, ἤγγειλ᾽ ὅττι ῥά οἱ πόσις ἔκτοθι μίμνε πυλάων [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __I.b in Attic dialect, ὅτι takes indicative after primary tenses, indicative or
  optative after secondary tenses, e.g. ἐνδείκνυμαι ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι σοφός [Refs 5th c.BC+]
  news came that Megara had (literal has) revolted, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: sometimes optative
  and indicative are found in the same sentence, ἔλεγον, ὅτι Κῦρος μὲν τέθνηκεν, Ἀριαῖος
  δὲ πεφευγὼς.. εἴη [Refs 5th c.BC+].. and the accusative with infinitive are found
  together, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.2 when ὅτι introduces a conditional sentence, the Constr. after ὅτι is the same
  as in independent conditional sentences, εἴ τις ἔροιτο, καθ᾽ ὁποίους νόμους δεῖ
  πολιτεύεσθαι, δῆλον ὅτι ἀποκρίναισθ᾽ ἄν.. it is manifest that you would answer..,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II ὅτι is frequently inserted pleonastic in introducing a quotation (where we
  use no conjunction and put inverted commas), λόγον τόνδε ἐκφαίνει ὁ Πρωτεύς, λέγων
  ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰ μὴ περὶ πολλοῦ ἡγεύμην.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπον, ὅ. ἡ αὐτή μοι
  ἀρχή ἐστι.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; even where the quotation consists of one word,[Refs]

  __II.2 ὅ. is also used pleonastic with the infinitive and accusative [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  but ὅτι has frequently been wrongly inserted by the copyists, as if εἶπεν or λέγουσιν
  must be followed by it, as in [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __III ὅτι in Attic dialect frequently represents a whole sentence, especially in
  affirmative answers, οὐκοῦν.. τὸ ἀδικεῖν κάκιον ἂν εἴη τοῦ ἀδικεῖσθαι. Answ. δῆλον
  δὴ ὅτι (i.e. ὅτι κάκιον ἂν εἴη, or ὅτι ταῦτα οὕτως ἔχει) [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare
  οἶδ᾽ ὅτι, ἴσθ᾽ ὅτι, οἶσθ᾽ ὅτι, [Refs 5th c.BC+] adverb

  __III.2 what we make the subject of the Verb which follows ὅτι frequently stands
  in the preceding clause, Αυκάονας δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ εἴδομεν, ὅτι.. καρποῦνται (for εἴδομεν,
  ὅτι Λυκάονες καρποῦνται) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __IV ὅτι sometimes = with regard to the fact that, ὅτι.. οὔ φησι.. ὄνομα εἶναι,
  ὑποπτεύω αὐτὸν σκώπτειν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __V οὐχ ὅ..., ἀλλὰ or ἀλλὰ καὶ.., οὐχ ὅ. ὁ Κρίτων ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ ἦν, ἀλλὰ οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ
  not only [Refs 1st c.AD+].., but his friends, [Refs 5th c.BC+] not only the powers
  in Europe, but.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]., not followed by a second clause, means although,
  οὐχ ὅ. παίζει καί φησι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __V.2 for ὅτι μή, see at {ὅ τι} 11.

  __B as a causal Particle, for that, because, generally after Verbs of feeling, [Refs
  8th c.BC+]: but without such a Verb, ὃν περὶ πάσης τῖεν ὁμηλικίης, ὅτι οἱ φρεσὶν
  ἄρτια ᾔδη [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.b followed by τί, ὅτι τ; why? (literal because why?) [Refs 4th c.BC+]; ὅτι τί
  δ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὅτι δὴ τί μάλιστ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὅτι δὴ τί γ; [Refs]; compare
  ὁτιή.

  __B.2 seeing that, in giving the reason for saying what is said, γλαυκὴ δέ σε τίκτε
  θάλασσα.. ὅτι τοι νόος ἐστὶν ἀπηνής as is proved by the fact that.., [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  (ὅ τ᾽) probably always represents ὅτε (ὅ τε): there are no examples of ὅττ᾽: hiatus
  after ὅτι is permitted in Comedy texts, [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
