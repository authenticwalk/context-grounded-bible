etymology: 'ἀνήρ, ὁ, ἀνδρός, ἀνδρί, ἄνδρα,

  vocative ἄνερ: plural ἄνδρες, -δρῶν, -δράσι [ᾰ], -dras: Aeolic dialect dative plural
  ἄνδρεσι[Refs 7th c.BC+] for οἱ ἄνδρε; the Ionic dialect crasis is ὡνήρ, ὧνδρες,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] [Epic dialect Poets mostly use ᾱ in arsi, ᾰ in thesi; but in trisyllable
  forms with stem ἀνέρ- always ; so also Trag. in Lyric poetry, [Refs 5th c.BC+] in
  nominative by analogy; cf. Sanskrit nar- from I.-[Refs 5th c.BC+] ner-, nṛ- from
  nṛ-, Gk. ἀνδρ- from ṇr-):—man, opposed to woman (ἄνθρωπος being man as opposed to
  to beast), [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἄπαις without male children, [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  mostly of princes, leaders, etc., but also of free men; ἀ δήμου one of the people,
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; with a qualifying word to indicate rank, ἀ. βουληφόρος[Refs 8th
  c.BC+]

  __II man, opposed to god, πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε [Refs]; Διὸς ἄγγελοι ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]: most common in plural, yet sometimes in singular, e.g. [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]:—also of men, opposed to monsters, [Refs 8th c.BC+]:—of men in societies
  and cities, οὔτε παρ᾽ ἀνδράσιν οὔτ᾽ ἐν ναυσὶ κοίλαις[Refs 5th c.BC+]; and so probably,
  ἄλλοτε μέν τ᾽ ἐπὶ Κύνθου ἐβήσαο.., ἄλλοτε δ᾽ ἂν νήσους τε καὶ ἀνέρας..[Refs]

  __III man, opposed to youth, unless the context determines the meaning, as in οὔ

  means a man in the prime of life, especially warrior, ἀ. ἕλεν ἄνδρα[Refs 8th c.BC+];
  the several ages are given as παῖς, μειράκιον, ἀ., πρεσβύτης[Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἰς
  ἄνδρας ἐγγράφεσθαι, συντελεῖν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in Inscrr. relating to contests,
  opposed to παῖδες, [Refs]

  __IV man emphatically, man indeed, ἀνέρες ἄστε, φίλοι[Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐκ ἐν ἀνδράσι

  part of a man.., [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  ὦ ἄνδρες gentlemen of the jury, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: hence in Comedy, ἄ. ἰχθύες[Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __VI.2 ὁ ἀνήρ, by crasis Attic dialect ἁνήρ, Ionic dialect ὡνήρ, is frequently used
  emphatically for αὐτός, ἐκεῖνος[Refs 5th c.BC+]: sometimes so in oblique cases without
