derivation: accusative case singular masculine of G3778 (οὗτος);
extended_definition: this  (person, as objective of verb or preposition) {STEPBible-TBESG}
etymology: 'οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο,

  genitive τούτου, ταύτης, τούτου, etc.: the dual feminine never in Attic dialect,
  see ὁ, ἡ, τό, [near the start]:—demonstrative pronoun, this, common from [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]

  __A ORIGIN and FORMS: οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο probably arose from a reduplication of
  the demonstrative ὁ, ἡ, τό with insertion of -υ- (= Sanskrit Particle u), e.g. ταῦτα
  from τα-υ-τα: Doric dialect genitive singular feminine τούτας [Refs 5th c.BC+],
  etc., the latter is uncertain in [Refs 5th c.BC+], as genitive singular neuter οὕτω
  [Refs 3rd c.BC+]; accusative singular feminine οὕταν [Refs 6th c.BC+] —In _Attic
  dialect_ οὗτος was frequently strengthened by the _demonstrative_ -ί, οὑτοσί, αὑτηί,
  τουτί, _genitive_ τουτουί, _dative_ τουτῳί, _accusative_ τουτονί; plural nominative
  οὑτοιί, neuter ταυτί, etc., this man here: sometimes a Particle is inserted between
  the pronoun and -ί, as αὑτηγί for αὑτηί γε, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τουτογί for τουτί
  γε, [Refs]; ταυταγί for ταυτί γε, [Refs]; τουτοδί for τουτὶ δέ, [Refs]; τουτουμενί
  for τουτουὶ μέν, [Refs] —In codices the ν ἐφελκυστικόν is sometimes added in the
  forms οὑτοσίν, οὑτωσίν, and οὑτοσίν is said to be Attic dialect by [Refs 2nd c.AD+].
  [This ι is always long, and a long vowel or diphthong before it becomes short, as
  αὑτη?~Xί, τουτω?~Xί, οὑτοῐί, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B USAGE in regard to CONCOR[Refs 4th c.BC+] is frequently used as a pronoun substantive:
  hence neuter is followed by genitive, κατὰ τοῦτο τῆς ἀκροπόλιος [Refs 5th c.BC+]
  adjective, in which case its substantive commonly takes the Article, οὗτος ὁ ἀνήρ
  or ὁ ἀνὴρ οὗτος.—But the Article is absent,

  __B.1 always in Epic dialect Poets (except [Refs 8th c.BC+]: sometimes also in Trag.,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.2 sometimes when the Noun is so specified that the Article is not needed, ἐς
  γῆν ταύτην.., ἥντινα νῦν Σκύθαι νέμονται [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.3 when οὗτος is used in local sense, here, see below with [Refs]

  __B.4 when the Noun with which οὗτος agrees stands as its Predicate, αὕτη γὰρ ἦν
  σοι πρόφασις [Refs 5th c.BC+]; δικαστοῦ αὕτη ἀρετή [ἐστι] [Refs 5th c.BC+] these
  were the grievances which already existed, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ταύτην φήμην παρέδοσαν
  this was the report which.., [Refs 5th c.BC+] this was notably the greatest movement
  which.., [NT+5th c.BC+]

  __B.5 when 3rd pers. is used for 2nd pers. to express contempt, οὗτος ἀνήρ, οὑτοσὶ
  ἀνήρ, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II though οὗτος usually agrees with the Noun that serves as Predicate, it is
  not rare to find it in the neuter, μανία δὲ καὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἐστί [Refs 5th c.BC+]: and
  in plural, οὐκ ἔστι ταῦτα ἀρχή [Refs 4th c.BC+]: so with an explanatory clause added,
  τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν ὁ συκοφάντης, αἰτιᾶσθαι μὲν πάντα ἐξελέγξαι δὲ μηδέν [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2 so also with a Noun in apposition, τούτοισιν μὲν ταῦτα μέλει, κίθαρις καὶ
  ἀοιδή [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.II.3 the neuter also may refer to a masculine or feminine Noun, καρπὸν φορέει
  κυάμῳ ἴσον: τοῦτο ἐπεὰν γένηται πέπον κτλ. [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.II.4 the neuter is also used of classes of persons, μελιτοπῶλαι καὶ τυροπῶλαι:
  τοῦτο δ᾽ εἰς ἕν ἐστι συγκεκυφός [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or of an abstract fact, οὐκ Ἰοφῶν
  ζ;—τοῦτο γάρ τοι καὶ μόνον ἔτ᾽ ἐστὶ λοιπὸν ἀγαθόν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III with Prons.,

  __B.III.1 personal, οὗτος σύ, in local sense, see below

  __B.III.2 interrogative, τί τοῦτ᾽ ἔλεξα; what is this that.. ? [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ποίοισι τούτοι; for ποῖά ἐστι ταῦτα οἷς [ἔχεις ἐλπίδα]; [Refs]; Νέστορ᾽ ἔρειο ὅν
  τινα τοῦτον ἄγει whom he brings here, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.III.3 with οἷος, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.III.4 possessive, πατὴρ σὸς οὗτος this father of thine, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III.5 demonstrative, οὗτος ἐκεῖνος, τὸν σὺ ζητέεις, where ἐκεῖνος is the Predicate,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τοῦτον τὸν αὐτὸν ἄνδρα this same man, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __B.III.5.b exceptionally, Διφίλου οὗτος ὅδ᾽ ἐστὶ τύπος [Refs]

  __B.III.6 ἄλλος τις οὗτος ἀνέστη another man here, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.IV with Numerals, τέθνηκε ταῦτα τρία ἔτη these three years, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  [στρατείαν] ἑνδέκατον μῆνα τουτονὶ ποιεῖται for these eleven months, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C SIGNIFICATION AND SPECIAL IDIOMS:

  __C.I this, to designate the nearer, opposed to ἐκεῖνος, that, the more remote,
  ταῦτα, like τὰ ἐνταῦθα, things round and about us, earthly things, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  compare ὅδε [near the start]: but οὗτος sometimes indicates that which is not really
  nearest, but most important, δεῖ.. τὸ βέλτιστον ἀεί, μὴ τὸ ῥᾷστον λέγειν: ἐπὶ ἐκεῖνο
  μὲν γὰρ ἡ φύσις αὐτὴ βαδιεῖται, ἐπὶ τοῦτο δὲ κτλ. [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __C.I.2 when, of two things, one precedes and the other follows, ὅδε properly refers
  to what follows, οὗτος to what precedes, οὐκ ἔστι σοι ταῦτ᾽, ἀλλά σοι τάδ᾽ ἔστι
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] refers to what follows, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὔκουν.. τοῦτο γιγνώσκεις,
  ὅτι..; [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __C.I.3 οὗτος is used emphatic, generally in contempt, while ἐκεῖνος denotes praise,
  ὁ πάντ᾽ ἄναλκις οὗτος, i.e. Aegisthus, [Refs 5th c.BC+] of Philip; but οὗτος is
  used of Philip, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __C.I.3.b of what is familiar, τούτους τοὺς πολυτελεῖς χιτῶνας, of the Persians,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ θυλακῶδες τοῦτο the familiar bag-like thing, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __C.I.4 in Attic dialect law-language, οὗτος is commonly applied to the opponent,
  whether plaintiff (as in [Refs 4th c.BC+] or defendant (as in [Refs]; so, in the
  political speeches of [Refs 4th c.BC+] are the opposite party, [Refs], etc.; but
  in the forensic speeches, οὗτοι frequently means the judges, the court, [Refs]

  __C.I.5 much like an adverb, in local sense (compare ὅδε [near the start]), τίς
  δ᾽ οὗτος κατὰ νῆας.. ἔρχεα; who art thou here that comest.. ? [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  frequently in Attic dialect, τίς οὑτοσ; who''s this here? [Refs 5th c.BC+]; πολλὰ
  ὁρῶ ταῦτα πρόβατα I see many sheep here, [Refs 5th c.BC+] ho you! you there! [Refs
  5th c.BC+]: with a proper name, ὦ οὗτος, Αἴας [Refs 5th c.BC+] —This phrase mostly
  implies anger, impatience, or scorn.

  __C.II simply as antecedent to ὅς, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __C.III = τοιοῦτος, οὗτος ἐγὼ ταχυτᾶτι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.IV after a parenthesis, the Subject, though already named, is frequently emphatic
  repeated by οὗτος, οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ Ἀριστέης.., οὐδὲ οὗτος προσωτέρω.. ἔφησε ἀπικέσθαι
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.V καὶ οὗτος is added to heighten the force of a previous word, ξυνεστῶτες..
  ναυτικῷ ἀγῶνι, καὶ τούτῳ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους [Refs 5th c.BC+]; see infr. VIII.2.

  __C.VI repeated, where for the second we should merely say he or it, τοῖσιν τούτου
  τοῦτον μέλεσιν.. κελαδοῦντες [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VII ταῦτα is used in some special phrases,

  __C.VII.1 ταῦτ᾽, ὦ δέσποτα yes Sir (i. e. ἔστι ταῦτα, ταῦτα δράσω, etc.), [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; so also ἦν ταῦτα even so, true, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VII.2 ταῦτα μὲν δὴ ὑπάρξει so it shall be, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VII.3 καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ ταῦτα so much for that, frequently in Attic dialect,
  as [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VII.4 ταῦτα at end of a formula in epitaphs, etc., probably short for ταῦτα
  οὕτως ἔχει or ὁ βίος ταῦτά ἐστιν, e.g. οὐδὶς (= -εὶς) ἀθάνατος: ταῦτα [Refs 2nd
  c.AD+]

  __C.VIII Adverbial usages:

  __C.VIII.1 ταῦταabsolutely, therefore, that is why.., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; αὐτὰ ταῦτα
  ἥκω, ἵνα.. [Refs 5th c.BC+] is rare in this sense, τοῦτ᾽ ἀφικόμην, ὅπως.. εὖ πράξαιμί
  τι [Refs 5th c.BC+]; αὐτὸ γὰρ τοῦτο just because of this, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.1.b πρὸς ταῦτα so then, therefore, properly used in indignant defiance,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.2 καὶ ταῦτα, adding a circumstance heightening the force of what has been
  said, and that, ἄνδρα γενναῖον θανεῖν, καὶ ταῦτα πρὸς γυναικός [Refs 4th c.BC+]:
  but mostly with a participle, ὅς γ᾽ ἐξέλυσας ἄστυ.., καὶ ταῦθ᾽ ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν οὐδὲν ἐξειδὼς
  πλέον [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or with a participle omitted, ἥτις.. τὴν τεκοῦσαν ὕβρισεν,
  καὶ ταῦτα τηλικοῦτος (i.e. οὖσα) [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.2.b καὶ ταῦτα anyhow, no matter what happens (or happened), ἐπεχείρησας,
  οὐδὲν ὢν καὶ ταῦτα you tried, but were no good anyhow, i.e. try as you might, [Refs
  4th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.3 τοῦτο μέν.., τοῦτο δέ.. on the one hand.., on the other.., partly..,
  partly.., very frequently in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τοῦτο μέν is sometimes answered by
  δέ only,[Refs 5th c.BC+]; by δὲ αὖ, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; by ἔπειτα δέ, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  by ἀλλά, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; by εἶτα, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; by τοῦτ᾽ αὖθις, [Refs]

  __C.VIII.4 dative feminine ταύτῃ,

  __C.VIII.4.a on this spot, here, ταύτῃ μὲν.., τῇδε δ᾽ αὖ.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.4.b in this point, herein, μηδὲν ταύτῃ γε κομήσῃς [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.4.c in this way, thus, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; to ὅπῃ, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ταύτῃ
  καλεῖσθαι, etc., like οὕτω κ., [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.5 ἐκ τούτου or τούτων thereupon, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; therefore, [Refs]

  __C.VIII.6 ἐν τούτῳ in that case, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.6.b in the meantime, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.VIII.7 πρὸς τούτοις (-οισι) besides, [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
