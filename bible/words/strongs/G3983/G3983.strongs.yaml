etymology: 'πειν-άω,

  forms in αε contraction into η not ᾱ (as in διψάω,[Refs 2nd c.AD+], πεινῇς, -ῇ [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; infinitive πεινῆν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Epic dialect πεινήμεναι [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]: imperfect ἐπείνων [Refs 5th c.BC+]: future πεινήσω [Refs 5th c.BC+]; later
  πεινάσω [ᾱ] [LXX+NT]: aorist ἐπείνησα [LXX+5th c.BC+]: perfect πεπείνηκα [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]: later we find the contraction of αε into ᾱ, ἐπείνας, πεινᾷ, -ᾶν, [LXX+NT]:
  (πεῖνἀ):—to be hungry, πεινάων, of a lion, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; κακῶς π. to be starved,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; thrice in Trag., πεινῶσα [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II with genitive, hunger after, σίτου δ᾽ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔφη πεινήμεναι [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __II.2 metaphorically, hunger, crave after, χρημάτων [Refs 5th c.BC+]; simply, to
  be in want of, lack, πεινῶντες ἀγαθῶν [NT+5th c.BC+]. [ᾱ in un contraction forms
  in [Refs 8th c.BC+] [same place], and the Attic dialect contractions (-η- from -ηε-)
  agree; but πεινῶντι Doric dialect 3rd.pers. plural present indicative in [Refs 5th
  c.BC+] codices points to -ᾰοντι.] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
