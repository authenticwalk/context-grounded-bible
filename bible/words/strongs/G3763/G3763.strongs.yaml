etymology: 'οὐδέποτε,

  in Ionic dialect Prose οὐδέκοτε, Doric dialect οὐδέποκα probably in [Refs], etc.:—conjunction
  and adverb and not ever or nor ever, not even ever or never, in [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  mostly with past tenses, [Refs 8th c.BC+]: but with present, [Refs 8th c.BC+]: with
  future, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; in Attic dialect, οὐδέποτε is commonly found with present
  or future (or its equivalent, as in οὐδέποτε μὴ λειφθῇ [Refs 1st c.AD+] with past
  tenses, so οὐδέποτε ἐπὶ μέλλοντος.., ἐπὶ δὲ παρῳχημένου τὸ οὐδεπώποτε [Refs 5th
  c.BC+] occurs with past tenses in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare οὐδέποτε tam in praeterito
  quam in futuro, quomodo et nos ''nunquam'', [Refs 5th c.AD+]: in late writers the
  reference of πω to past time was neglected, see at {οὐδεπώποτε}, and[Refs 1st c.AD+];
  compare οὐδέπω, οὔποτε, οὔπω, οὐπώποτε, also μηδέποτε, μηπώποτε.—In [Refs 8th c.BC+]
  should probably be written divisim: sometimes a word is put between, as in [Refs
  8th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
