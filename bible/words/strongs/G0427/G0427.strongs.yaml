  opposed to σύν, ἄνευ ἕθεν οὐδὲ σὺν αὐτῷ 11.17.407; ἄ. κέντροιο without the goad,
  23.387; μόνος ἄ. τινός[Refs 5th c.BC+]; in pregnant sense, ἄ. θεῶν, mostly with
  negative, οὔτι ἄ. θεοῦ ἥδε γε βουλή[Refs 8th c.BC+]; also without negative, ἄ. ἐμέθεν

  later Prose, as always in [Refs 4th c.BC+] (Cf. Gothic inu, OHG. ᾱνο ''without'';
  perhaps akin to negative pref. ἀ-.) {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
