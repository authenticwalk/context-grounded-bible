  c.BC+]; ἀνὰ μέλαθρον up to,[Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἂν ῥόον up-stream, [Refs]; κρῆς ἂν
  τὸν ὀδελὸν ἐμπεπαρμένον[Refs 5th c.BC+]; simply, along, ἂν τὼς ὄρως[Refs]

  __C.I.2 up and down, throughout, ἀνὰ δῶμα[Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἀνὰ στρατόν, ἄστυ, ὅμιλον,[Refs
  8th c.BC+]; ἀνὰ πᾶσαν τὴν Μηδικήν, ἀνὰ τὴν Ἑλλάδα, [Refs 7th c.BC+]; ἀνὰ τὸ σκοτεινόν
  in the darkness, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __C.I.3 metaphorically, ἀνὰ θυμὸν φρονέειν, ἀνὰ στόμα ἔχειν, to have continually
  in the mind, in the mouth, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἀν᾽ Αἰγυπτίους ἄνδρας among them, [Refs

  __D WITH NOM. of Numerals, etc., distributively, [NT+2nd c.AD+]

  __E WITHOUT CASE as adverb, thereupon, [Refs 8th c.BC+] and other Poets:— and with
  the notion of spreading all over a space, throughout, all over, μέλανες δ᾽ ἀνὰ βότρυες
  ἦσαν all over there were clusters, [Refs 8th c.BC+] —but ἀνά often looks like an
  adverb in [Refs 8th c.BC+], where really it is only parted from its Verb by tmesis,
  ἀνὰ δ᾽ ἔσχετ; ἀνὰ δ᾽ ὦρτο (for ἀνῶρτο δέ); ἀνὰ τεύχε᾽ ἀείρας (for τεύχεα ἀναείρας),
  etc.

  __F IN COMPOSITION (joined with other words),

  __F.1 as in C. 1, up to, upwards, up, opposed to κατά, as ἀνα-βαίνω, -βλέπω, ἀν-αιρέω,
  -ίστημι: poetry sometimes doubled, ἀν᾽ ὀρσοθύρην ἀναβαίνειν[Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __F.2 hence flows the sense of increase or strengthening, as in ἀνακρίν; though
  it cannot always be translated, as in Homer''s ἀνείρομαι:—in this case opposed to
  ὑπό.

  __F.3 from the notion throughout (E), comes that of repetition and improvement,
  as in ἀνα-βλαστάνω, -βιόω, -γεννάω.

  __F.4 the notion of back, backwards, in ἀναχωρέω, ἀνανεύω, etc., seems to come from
  such phrases as ἀνὰ ῥόον up, i. e. against, the stream.

  __G ἄνα, written with anastrophe as adverb, up! arise! ἀλλ᾽ ἄνα[Refs 8th c.BC+]:—in
  this sense the ultima  is never elided;[Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __G.2 apocopation ἄν after ὤρνυτο, ὦρτο, and up stood.. arose, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __G.3 when used as preposition ἀνά never suffers anastrophe. {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
