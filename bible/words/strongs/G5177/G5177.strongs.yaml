strongs_number: G5177
language: greek
lemma: τυγχάνω
transliteration: tynchánō
definition: akin to the base of G5088 (τίκτω) through the idea of effecting; properly,
  to affect; or (specially), to hit or light upon (as a mark to be reached), i.e.
  (transitively) to attain or secure an object or end, or (intransitively) to happen
  (as if meeting with); but in the latter application only impersonal (with G1487
  (εἰ)), i.e. perchance; or (present participle) as adjective, usual (as if commonly
  met with, with G3756 (οὐ), extraordinary), neuter (as adverb) perhaps; or (with
  another verb) as adverb, by accident (as it were)
kjv_usage: be, chance, enjoy, little, obtain, X refresh…self, + special
derivation: probably for an obsolete (for which the middle voice of another alternate
  (to make ready or bring to pass) is used in certain tenses;

  __3.b with accusative et infinitive, ἔτυχε ὄμβρον συνεργῆσαι [Refs 1st c.AD+]; ἔτυχεν

  __4 sometimes the Verb agrees in person and number with the subject of the principal
  clause, perhaps by assimilation, ἀπαίροντες ἀπὸ τῆς Πελοποννήσου ὁπόθεν τύχοιεν,
  for ὁπόθεν τύχοι, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὅ τι ἂν τύχωσι, τοῦτο λέγουσι they say just

  λωβωμένη she is just the one who.., [Refs 7th c.BC+]; but frequently τυγχάνω cannot
  be translated at all, especially in phrase τυγχάνω ὤν, which is simply ={εἰμί},
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 the participle ὤν is sometimes omitted, ὁ γὰρ μέγιστος τυγχάνει δορυξένων
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; νῦν δ᾽ ἀγροῖσι τυγχάνει[Refs 5th c.BC+] is used much like{εἶναι,

  we have just handed in.., [Refs 2nd c.BC+]

  __B gain one''s end or purpose, succeed, οὐκ ἐτύχησεν ἑλίξας [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τὸ
  τυχεῖν, ={νίκη}, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τυχόντες if successful, opposed to σφαλέντες,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; gain one''s request, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in speaking, to be right,
  τί νιν καλοῦσα.. τύχοιμ᾽ ἄ; [Refs 5th c.BC+] —passive, impersonal, αὐτῷ πρὸς τὸ
  ἔργον οὐδὲν ἐτυγχάνετο nothing went right, uncertain in [Refs 2nd c.AD+] —in participle
  τυχήσας or τυχών, combined with νύξε, βάλε, οὖτα, etc., pierce, wound, etc., successfully,
  so that the whole phrase means hit, ἔγχεϊ νύξε κατὰ κληῗδα τυχήσας [Refs 8th c.BC+];

  μελαμπύγου τύχῃς [Refs 7th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2 light on a thing, τύχε γάρ ἀμάθοιο βαθείης [Refs 8th c.BC+]; attain, obtain
  a thing, with genitive, πομπῆς καὶ νόστοιο [Refs 8th c.BC+]; [οἴκτου] [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; of meeting with misfortunes, βίης τυχεῖν meet with, suffer violence, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τραυμάτων, κακῶν, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; δίκης, κρίσεως, [Refs 5th c.BC+]:
  absolutely, have the lot or fate, ἄλλος μὲν ἀποφθίσθω ἄλλος δὲ βιώτω, ὅς κε τύχῃ
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2.b after [Refs 8th c.BC+] also with accusative of neuter adjective or pronoun,
  τὰ πρόσφορα [Refs 5th c.BC+]: later the accusative is used more freely, τ. ἐπίστασιν
  [Refs 1st c.AD+]; ὑπογραφήν [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; βοήθειαν [Refs 4th c.AD+]; εὐκαιρίαν
  [Refs 4th c.AD+]; τὰ γυναίκια δεσμὸν οὐδένα βούλεται τυγχάνειν [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __B.II.2.c after either case a genitive person may be added, obtain a thing from
  a person, ὧν δέ σου τυχεῖν ἐφίεμαι [Refs 5th c.BC+]; or the person may be added
  with a preposition, τ. ἐπαίνου ἔκ τινος [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __B.II.2.d with infinitive, οἶμαί σου τεύξεσθαι μεθεῖναί με [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ
  τυχὼν ἐπιδείξειν (={ἐπιδεῖξαι}) not having succeeded in proving, [Refs 3rd c.BC+]aorist
  τυχ-εῖν, which was originally the aorist passive (with active form) of τεύχω ''make'';
  ἔτυχε = factum est, as ἔτραφον = I was nourished (see. τρέφω); senses [Refs 4th
  c.BC+]; many of the forms belong equally to both verbs; τιτύσκομαι like wise belongs
  to both verbs; τ(ε)υχ- from *θ(ε)υχ-, compare ἀποθύσκειν, ἐνθύσκει, συνθύξω, and
  perhaps [Refs 1st c.BC+] taugen ''to be capable, useful'', Engl. dow, doughty.)
