etymology: 'στοιχεῖον, τό:

  __I in a form of sun-dial, the shadow of the gnomon, the length of which in feet
  indicated the time of day, ὅταν ᾖ δεκάπουν τὸ σ. when the shadow is ten feet long,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+], see [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __II element,

  __II.1 a simple sound of speech, as the first component of the syllable, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; τὸ ῥῶ τὸ σ[Refs 4th c.BC+] —στοιχεῖα therefore, strictly, were different
  from letters (γράμματα), [Refs 2nd c.BC+], but are frequently not clearly distinguished
  from them, as by [Refs 5th c.BC+]; σ. ε ¯ letter ε (in a filing-system), [Refs 2nd
  c.AD+]; ἀκουόμενα σ. letters which are pronounced, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; γράμματα and
  ς. are expressly identified by [Refs 2nd c.BC+]; the ς. and its name are confused
  by [Refs 2nd c.BC+] — κατὰ στοιχεῖον in the order of the letters, alphabetically,
  [Refs 1st c.AD+]

  __II.2 in Physics, στοιχεῖα were the components into which matter is ultimately
  divisible, elements, reduced to four by Empedocles, who called them ῥιζὤματα, the
  word στοιχεῖα being first used (accusative to [Refs 5th c.BC+], τὰ πρῶτα οἱονπερεὶ
  σ, ἐξ ὧν ἡμεῖς τε συγκείμεθα καὶ τἄλλα [Refs]; τὰ τῶν πάντων σ. [Refs 4th c.BC+];
  ἄτομα σ. [Refs 4th c.BC+]; equivalent to ἀρχαί, Thales cited in [Refs 6th c.BC+]
  also distinguishes ς. from ἀρχή as less comprehensive, [Refs]; τὰ σ. ὕλη τῆς οὐσίας
  [Refs]; τρία τὰ σ. [Refs]; distinguished from ἀρχή on other grounds by [Refs]; ς.
  used in three senses by Chrysipp., [Refs]; in Medicine, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; ἀνηλεὲς
  σ., of the sea, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; τὸ σ., of the sea, [Refs 1st c.AD+]; ἄμφω τὰ σ.,
  i.e. land and sea,[Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __II.3 the elements of proof, e.g. in general reasoning the πρῶτοι συλλογισμοί,
  [Refs 4th c.BC+]; in Geometry, the propositions whose proof is involved in the proof
  of other propositions,[Refs]; title of geometrical works by Hippocrates of Chios,
  Leon, Theudios, and Euclid, [Refs 5th c.AD+]: hence applied to whatever is one,
  small, and capable of many uses, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; to whatever is most universal,
  e.g. the unit and the point,[Refs]; the line and the circle, [Refs]; τὸ νόμισμα
  σ. καὶ πέρας τῆς ἀλλαγῆς coin is the unit.. of exchange, [Refs]; in Grammar, σ.
  τῆς λέξεως parts of speech, [Refs 1st c.BC+]; but also, the letters composing a
  word, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; letters of the alphabet, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; σ. τοῦ λόγου
  the elements of speech, i.e.  words, or the kinds of words, parts of speech, [Refs
  4th c.BC+]

  __II.4 generally, elementary or fundamental principle, ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ τῶν σ. [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τὸ πολλάκις εἰρημένον μέγιστον σ. [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __II.5 ἄστρων στοιχεῖα the stars, [NT+4th c.AD+]; especially planets, στοιχείῳ Διός
  [Refs 1st c.AD+]; so perhaps in [NT]; especially a sign of the Zodiac, [Refs 3rd
  c.AD+]; of the Great Bear, [Refs]
