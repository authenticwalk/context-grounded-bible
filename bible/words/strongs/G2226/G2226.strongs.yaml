  ζῴων τ. αἷμα, Heb.13:11; ἄλογα ζ., 2Pe.2:12, Ju 10.†

  SYN.: θηρίον, in which the brutal, bestial element is emphasized, and which is never
  used of sacrificial animals. On the other hand, ζ. is the more comprehensive, as
  expressing the vital element common to the whole anima] creation (see Tr., Syn.,
  LXXxi; Cremer, 274).  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
etymology: 'ζῷον, τό,

  living being, animal, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ζῷα, opposed to φυτά, [Refs]; ζ. θαλάττιον,
  χερσαῖον, [Refs 1st c.BC+].; contemptuously, ὅπως ἡ χώρα τοῦ τοιούτου ζῴου καθαρὰ
  γίγνηται may be free from this kind of animal (i.e. beggars), [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ζ. πονηρόν, of women, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __II in art, figure, image, not necessarily of animals (compare ζῴδιον), ζῷον δέ
  οἱ ἐνῆν, ἀνὴρ ἱππεύς [Refs 5th c.BC+]: mostly in plural, ζῷα ἐς τὴν ἐσθῆτα ἐγγράφειν
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ζῷα γράψασθαι τὴν ζεῦξιν τοῦ Βοσπόρου to have pictures of the
  bridging of the Bosporus painted, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare ζωγραφέω: ζῷα ποιεῖν
  [Refs 1st c.AD+]

  __III sign of the Zodiac, [Refs 8th c.BC+], no generic word used for animal being
  found till after the middle of the fifth cent. BC [Refs 7th c.BC+] by contraction:
  ι is found in [Refs 3rd c.BC+]., and in codices optative in the Noun; the adjective
  ζωός (which see) had no ι: for the compounds (except ζωγλύφος, ζωγράφος) decisive
  evidence is lacking: ζῳάγρια with ι was read by [Refs 8th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
