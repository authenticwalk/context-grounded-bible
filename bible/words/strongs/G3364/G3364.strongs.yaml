etymology: 'οὐ μή,

  in independent sentences, is used either in Denial or in Prohibition:

  __I in Denial,

  __I.1 with subjunctive,

  __I.1.a chiefly of aorist, οὔ τι μὴ ληφθῶ δόλῳ [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.1.b rarely of present, mostly with Verbs expressing possibility or ability,
  οὐ μὴ δύνηται (variant{δυνήσεται}) [Refs 5th c.BC+], and this has been adopted by
  most editions; and in [Refs 4th c.BC+] with subjunctive probably arose from the
  ellipsis of a Verb or phrase expressing fear or apprehension; such words are sometimes
  expressed, οὐ γὰρ ἦν δεινὸν.. μὴ ἁλῷ κοτε [Refs 5th c.BC+]—Sts. there is no idea
  of fear, as in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; the construction is freely used after ὅτι, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; after ὡς, since, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; after ὥστε, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __I.2 with future indicative, οὔ σοι μὴ μεθέψομαί ποτε [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ μὴ δέξονται
  (variant{δέξωνται}) [Refs 5th c.BC+]: or infinitive, εἶπεν.. οὐ μή ποτε.. εὖ πράξειν
  πόλιν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II in Prohibition, οὐ μή is used interrogatively with future indicative (chiefly
  of the  2 _person_) so as to express a strong prohibition, οὐ μὴ ''ξεγερεῖς τὸν
  ὕπνῳ κάτοχο; ={μὴ ἐξέγειρε},[Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ μὴ προσοίσεις χεῖρα μηδ᾽ ἅψῃ πέπλων
  ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐ μὴ προσοίσεις χεῖρα βακχεύσεις δ᾽ ἰών;[Refs]

  __II.2 later οὐ μὴ ἐμπέσω let me not fall, [LXX]

  __II.3 in questions, οὐ μή, = Latin nonne, ὁ θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν
  ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ ; [NT]

  __III in [Refs 4th c.BC+]; seems to mean keep silent and say nothing.., σῖγα being
  short for σιγήσει and καὶ being omitted: similarly, οὐ σῖγ᾽ ἀνέξει, μηδὲ δειλίαν
  ἀρῇ; submit silently and do not play the coward, [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
