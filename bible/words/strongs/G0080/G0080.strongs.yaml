lemma: ἀδελφός

definition: a brother (literally or figuratively) near or remote (much like G1 (Α))
kjv_usage: brother
derivation: from G1 (Α) (as a connective particle) and (the womb);
extended_definition: 'ἀδελφός, -οῦ, ὁ

  (ἀ- copul., δελφύς, womb),

  in cl., a brother, born of the same parent or parents. [In LXX (Hort, Ja., 102f.),
  for אָח ;]

  __1. lit. of a brother (Gen.4:2, al.).

  __2. Of a neighbour (Lev.19:17).

  __3. Of a member of the same nation (Exo.2:14, Deu.15:3). In NT in each of these
  senses (1. Mat.1:2, al.; 2. Mat.7:3; 3. Rom.9:3) and also,

  __4. of a fellow-Christian: 1Co.1:1, Act.9:30. This usage finds illustration in
  π., where ἀ. is used of members of a pagan religious community (M, Th., I, 1:4;
  MM, VGT, see word). The ἀδελφοὶ τ. Κυρίου (Mat.12:46-49 13:55 28:10, Mrk.3:31-34,
  Luk.8:19-21, Jhn.2:12 7:3, 5 10 20:17, Act.1:14, 1Co.9:5) may have been sons of
  Joseph and Mary (Mayor, Ja., Intr. viff.; DB, i, 320ff.) or of Joseph by a former
  marriage (Lft., Gal., 252ff.; DCG, i, 232ff.), but the view of Jerome, which makes
  ἀ. equivalent to ἀνεψιός, is inconsistent with Greek usage. (Cremer, 66.)
