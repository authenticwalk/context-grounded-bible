etymology: 'οὖν,

  Ionic dialect and Doric dialect ὦν (the latter in [Refs 8th c.BC+], adverb certainly,
  in fact, confirming something, frequently in contrast with something which is not
  confirmed, in [Refs 8th c.BC+] only in combination with γε (see. γοῦν), γάρ, οὔτε
  or μήτε, ὡς, ἐπεί, μέν, etc.:

  __1 really, φημὶ γὰρ οὖν κατανεῦσαι.. Κρονίωνα for I declare that Zeus did really
  promise.., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τόφρα γὰρ οὖν ἑπόμεσθα.., ὄφρ᾽ for we followed them
  up to the very point, where.., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἐλέχθησαν λόγοι ἄπιστοι μὲν ἐνίοισι
  Ἑλλήνων, ἐλέχθησαν δ᾽ ὦν but they really were spoken, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; Θηβαῖοι
  μὲν ταῦτα λέγουσι.., Πλαταιῆς δ᾽ οὐχ ὁμολογοῦσι.., ἐκ δ᾽ οὖν τῆς γῆς ἀνεχώρησαν
  at all events they did return, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so δ᾽ οὖν after a parenthesis;
  εἰ δή τις ὑμῶν οὕτως ἔχει,—οὐκ ἀξιῶ μὲν γὰρ ἔγωγε,—εἰ δ᾽ οὖν but if he is so, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; so ἀλλ᾽ οὖν.. γε but at all events, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἔμπης οὖν ἐπιμεῖναι
  ἐς αὔριον to stay nevertheless at least till to-morrow, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὖν concessive,
  I grant you, τάχ᾽ οὖν τις ἄκων ἔσχε [Refs 8th c.BC+]; Τληπόλεμος δ᾽, ἐπεὶ οὖν τράφ᾽
  ἐνὶ μεγάρῳ εὐπήκτῳ, αὐτίκα.. κατέκτα when once, i.e. as soon as, he had grown up,
  [Refs]; νεβροί, αἵ τ᾽ ἐπεὶ οὖν ἔκαμον.. ἑστᾶσ᾽ which, as soon as they are tired,
  stand still, [Refs]; to indicate that something foreshadowed has actually occurred,
  ἀγορήνδε καλέσσατο λαὸν Ἀχιλλεύς.., οἱ δ᾽ ἐπεὶ οὖν ἤγερθεν [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τὸν
  δ᾽ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησε [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὔτ᾽ οὖν.., οὔτε.. or οὔτε.., οὔτ᾽ οὖν.. both
  = neither.. nor, but preferred according as the first or second clause is to be
  marked by emphasis,[Refs 8th c.BC+]; so εἰ.., εἴτ᾽ οὖν.. if.., or if.., [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; εἴτ᾽ οὖν, εἴτε μὴ γενήσεται whether it shall be so, or no, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ξεῖνος αἴτ᾽ ὦν ἀστός, i.e. αἴτε ξ. αἴτ᾽ ὦν ἀ., [Refs 5th c.BC+] even as, just as,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἰ δ᾽ ἔστιν, ὥσπερ οὖν ἔστι, θεός if he is, as he in fact is,
  a god, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; for μὲν οὖν, see at {μέν} [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __2 added to indefinite Prons. and adverbs, like Latin cunque, ὅστις whoever, ὁστισοῦν
  whosoever; ὅπως how, ὁπωσοῦν howsoever; ἄλλος ὁστισοῦν another, be he who he may;
  so ὁποιοσοῦν, ὁποιοστισοῦν, ὁποσοσοῦν, ὁπωσδηποτοῦν, ὁπητιοῦν, ὁποθενοῦν, etc.,
  (see entry).

  __II to continue a narrative, so, then, καὶ τὰ μὲν οὖν.. θῆκαν [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ὅτ᾽ οὖν since, then,.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ζεῖ οὖν ἐν τούτῳ.. [Refs 5th c.BC+] is
  very common in this sense; so δ᾽ οὖν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὖν is also used alone merely
  to resume after a parenthesis or long protasis, well, as I was saying, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι,
  χρήσαντος τοῦ θεοῦ.., ὑμεας γὰρ πυνθάνομαι προεστάναι..,—ὑμέας ὦν.. προσκαλέομαι..
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 ὦν is frequently inserted by [Refs 5th c.BC+]participle, οἱ δὲ φέροντες ἐς
  τὴν ἀγορήν, ἀπ᾽ ὦν ἔδοντο[Refs]; so in [Refs 5th c.BC+]: this tmesis is rare in
  Attic dialect, ὥστε γε καὐτόν σε κατ᾽ οὖν ἔβαλεν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but occurs in
  later writers, Dorieus cited in [Refs 3rd c.BC+]

  __III in inferences, then, therefore, not in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; in a statement, [Refs];
  very common from [Refs 5th c.BC+] downwards; so καὶ σὺ οὖν you too therefore, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; compare οὐ γὰρ οὖν, τοιγαροῦν: strengthened, δὴ οὖν [Refs 5th c.BC+]:
  in questions, τίς οὖν ὁ λύσων σ᾽ ἐστίν ; [Refs 5th c.BC+], etc.; ἆρ᾽ οὖν δή ; [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τί οὖν δή ; [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
