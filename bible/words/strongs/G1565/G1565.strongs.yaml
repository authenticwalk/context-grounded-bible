etymology: 'ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο,

  also κεῖνος (regular in Epic dialect, Ionic dialect (as [Refs 5th c.BC+] only where
  the metre requires,[Refs 5th c.BC+], etc.; but not in Attic dialect Prose, and in
  Comedy texts only in mock Trag. passages): Aeolic dialect κῆνος [Refs 7th c.BC+]:
  Doric dialect τῆνος [Refs 3rd c.BC+]: in Comedy texts, strengthened ἐκεινοσί [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; ἐκεινοσίν [Refs 2nd c.AD+]: (ἐκεῖ):—demonstrative pronoun the person
  there, that person or thing, [Refs 8th c.BC+]: generally with reference to what
  has gone immediately before, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but when οὗτος and ἐκεῖνος refer
  to two things before mentioned, ἐκεῖνος, properly belongs to the more remote, in
  time, place, or thought, οὗτος to the nearer, [Refs 5th c.BC+] sometimes = the latter,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἆρ᾽ οὗτός ἐστ᾽ ἐκεῖνος ὅν..; [Refs 5th c.BC+]: also joined as
  if one pronoun, τοῦτ᾽ ἐκεῖνο..δέρκομαι [Refs 5th c.BC+]; κατ᾽ ἐκεῖνο καιροῦ at that
  point of time, [Refs 1st c.AD+]; ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖνο, à propos, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __2 to denote wellknown persons, etc., κεῖνος μέγας θεός [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __2.b ἐκεῖνα the ideal world, [Refs]

  __3 for things, of which one cannot remember or must not mention the name, ={ὁ δεῖνα},
  so-and-so, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __3.b in formulae, τεθνάτω καὶ οἱ παῖδες οἱ ἐξ ἐκείνου [Refs]

  __4 with simple demonstrative force, Ἶρος ἐκεῖνος ἧσται Irus sits there, [Refs 8th
  c.BC+]; νῆες ἐκεῖναι ἐπιπλέουσιν there are ships sailing up, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __5 in indirect speech where properly the reflexive pronoun αὑτοῦ would stand, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __6 after a Relat. in apodosi almost pleonastic, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __7 in Aeolic dialect and Attic dialect the substantive with ἐκεῖνος properly has
  the Article (κῆνος ὤνηρ [Refs 7th c.BC+] may precede or follow the substantive,
  ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὴν στρατείαν ἐ., τὸν ἄνδρ᾽ ἐ., [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  but when this is the case in Prose, ἐκεῖνος follows the substantive, ἡμέρας ἐκείνης
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II adverb ἐκείνως in that case, [Refs]; in that way, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: Ionic dialect
  κείνως [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __III dative feminine ἐκείνῃ as adverb,

  __III.1 of Place, at that place, in that neighbourhood, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; κείνῃ
  (i.e. ὁδῷ) [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __III.2 of Manner, in that manner, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __IV with Preps., ἐξ ἐκείνου from that time, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; κατ᾽ ἐκεῖνα in that
  region, [Refs 5th c.BC+]afterwards, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; compare ἐπέκεινα. {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
