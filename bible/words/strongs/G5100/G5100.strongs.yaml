  __A.II special usages:

  __A.II.1 some one (of many), i.e. many a one, ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν [Refs 8th c.BC+]:
  sometimes with meiosis, implying all or men,[Refs 8th c.BC+]; so in Prose, [Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.2 any one concerned, every one, εὖ μέν τις δόρυ θηξάσθω [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ἀλλά τις αὐτὸς ἴτω let every man come himself,[Refs]; so in Trag. and Attic dialect,
  even with the imperative, τοῦτό τις.. ἴστω S [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τοὺς ξυμμάχους αὐτόν
  τινα κολάζειν that every man should himself chastise his own allies, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  ἄμεινόν τινος better than any others, [Refs 4th c.BC+]:—this is more fully expressed
  by adding other pronominal words, τις ἕκαστος [Refs 8th c.BC+]. In these senses,
  τις is frequently combined with plural words, οἱ κακοὶ.. οὐκ ἴσασι, πρίν τις ἐκβάλῃ,
  for πρὶν ἐκβάλωσι, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οἷς ἂν ἐπίω, ἧσσόν τις πρόσεισι, for ἧσσον
  προσίασι, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; especially after εἴ or ἤν τις, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.3 in reference to a definite person, whom one wishes to avoid naming, οὐκ
  ἔφασαν ἰέναι, ἐὰν μή τις χρήματα διδῷ (i.e. Cyrus) [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so also euphemistic
  for something bad, ἤν τι ποιῶμεν [Refs 5th c.BC+]: hence for the 1st pers. or 2nd
  pers. pronoun, ἅ τιν᾽ οὐ πείσεσθαι ὀΐω [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ποῖ τις τρέψετα; for ποῖ
  τρέψομα; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  force, φοβεῖταί τις [Refs 4th c.BC+]; as vocative, τὸν Πλοῦτον ἔξω τις κάλει call
  P. out, somebody, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.5 τις, τι may be opposed, expressly or by implication, to οὐδείς, οὐδέν,
  and mean somebody, something, by meiosis for some great one, some great thing, ηὔχεις
  τις εἶναι you boasted that you were somebody, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; κἠγών τις φαίνομαι
  ἦμεν after all I too am somebody, [NT+3rd c.BC+]; also in neuter, οἴονταί τι εἶναι
  ὄντες οὐδενὸς ἄξιοι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.5.b τις is sometimes opposed to to another word, ἀελλοπόδων μέν τιν᾽ εὐφραίνοισιν
  ἵππων τιμαί.., τέρπεται δὲ καί τις.. [LXX+5th c.BC+]; ἔστιν οὖν οὐ πᾶν τὸ ταχύ,
  ἀλλά τι (sic codices BT) αὐτοῦ ἀγαστόν [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ μεῖζον τοῦθ᾽ ὅπερ ἐστὶν

  τῷ τυχόντι ἢ τισί; [Refs]

  __A.II.6 with (Proper name)s τις commonly signifies one named so-and-so, ἦν δέ τις
  ἐν Τρώεσσι Δάρης [Refs 8th c.BC+]; with a sense of contempt, Θερσίτης τις ἦν there
  was one Thersites, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.6.b one of the same sort, converting the (Proper name) into an appellative,
  ἤ τις Ἀπόλλων ἢ Πάν an Apollo or a Pan, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; [πόλιες] ταὶ μέλονται
  πρός τινος ἢ Διὸς ἢ γλαυκᾶς Ἀθάνας Lyric poetry in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἰσθμόν τιν᾽
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.7 with adjectives τις combines to express the idea of a substantive used
  as predicate, ὥς τις θαρσαλέος καὶ ἀναιδής ἐσσι προΐκτης a bold and impudent beggar,

  thing, [Refs]

  __A.II.8 with numerals and adjectives expressing number, size, or the like, εἷς
  δέ τις ἀρχὸς ἀνὴρ.. ἔστω some one man, [NT+8th c.BC+]; sometimes the τις softens
  the definiteness of the numeral, ἑπτά τινες some seven, seven or so, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  so without an actual numeral, ἡμέρας τινάς some days, i.e. several, [Refs]; στρατῷ
  τινι of a certain amount, considerable, [Refs]; ἐνιαυτόν τινα a year or so, [Refs];
  so οὐ πολλοί τινες, τινὲς οὐ πολλοί, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὀλίγοι τινές or τινὲς ὀλίγοι
  [Refs]; οὔ τινα πολλὸν χρόνον no very long time, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so also ὅσσος

  κύριος παρῇ τις when the person in authority, whoever he be, is here, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; τοὺς αὐτοέντας.. τιμωρεῖν τινας (variant τινα) [Refs]

  __A.II.10.b in Philosophic writers, τις is added to the Article to show that the
  Article is used to denote a particular individual who is not specified in the general
  formula, although he would be in the particular case, ὁ τὶς ἄνθρωπος the individual
  man (whoever he may be), this or that man, opposed to ἄνθρωπος (man in general),
  ὁ τὶς ἵππος, ἡ τὶς γραμματική, [Refs 4th c.BC+]; τὸ τὶ μέγεθος, opposed to ὅλως
  τὸ μέγεθος, [Refs 5th c.BC+], the Article is used as in [Refs 8th c.BC+] cc. (which
  see) ὁ, ἡ, τό [Refs 5th c.BC+], δεῦρο ὅ τις θεός, ὄφθητί μοι in a general formula
  of invocation, [Refs]

  __A.II.10.c frequently in opposed clauses, ὁ μέν τις.., ὁ δὲ.. [Refs 5th c.BC+],
  etc.: also combined with other alternative words, ὁ μέν τις.., ὁ δέ τις.., ἕτερος
  δέ τις.. [Refs]; ὁ μὲν.., ἕτερος δέ τις.., ὁ δὲ.., etc., [Refs 5th c.BC+]: also
  in neuter, τὸ μέν τι.., τὸ δέ τι.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in adverbial sense, τὸ μὲν..,
  τὸ δέ τι.. partly.., partly.. , [Refs 2nd c.BC+]; and τι remains unaltered even
  when the Article is plural, τὰ μέν τι μαχόμενοι, τὰ δὲ καὶ ἀναπαυόμενοι [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; also τὸ δέ τι.. but in some measure.., without τὸ μέν preceding, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]

  __A.II.10.d later τις is used as in b above but without the Article, γράψον.. ὅτι
  τι καί τι εἴληφας that you have received such and such things, [Refs 2nd c.AD+];
  τίς τινι χαίρειν [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __A.II the neuter τι is used,

  __A.II.a collectively, ἦν τι καὶ ἐν ταῖς Συρακούσαις there was a party.. , [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; so perhaps τῶν ἄλλων οὔ πέρ τι πεφυγμένον ἐστ᾽ Ἀφροδίτην, οὔτε θεῶν,
  οὔτ᾽ ἀνθρώπων no class, [Refs] (but masculine τις in [Refs]

  __A.II.b euphemistic for something bad, see above [Refs]

  __A.II.c joined with Verbs, somewhat, in any degree, at all, ἦ ῥά τί μοι κεχολώσεαι
  [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐ πάνυ τι, πολύ τι, σχεδόν τι, see at {πάνυ} [Refs]; also in
  conjunction with οὐδέν, μηδέν, οὐδέν τι πάντως [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὐδέν, μηδέν τι
  μᾶλλον, [Refs 5th c.BC+] —also καί τι καὶ.. ὑποψίᾳ in part also from suspicion,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.12 τίς τε frequently in [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __A.II.13 ἤ τις ἢ οὐδείς few or none, next to none, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἤ τι ἢ οὐδέν
  little or nothing, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.II.14 τις is pleonastic in such phrases as οὐδέν τι or μηδέν τι, see above [Refs]

  __A.II.14.b repeated in successive clauses, ὅσα λέγει τις ἢ πράσσειτις ἢψέγειν ἔχει
  [Refs 5th c.BC+] (whereas τις is sometimes omitted in the first clause, οὔτε φωνὴν
  οὔτε του μορφὴν βροτῶν [Refs 5th c.BC+], the repetition is pleonastic, as also in
  [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A.II.15 τις is sometimes omitted, οὐδέ κεν ἔνθα τεόν γε μένος καὶ χεῖρας ὄνοιτο
  (i.e. τις) [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ὡς δ᾽ ἐν ὀνείρῳ οὐ δύναται (i.e. τις) φεύγοντα διώκειν
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]: τις must often be supplied from what goes before,[Refs]

  __A.II.15.b sometimes also τις is omitted before a genitive case which must depend
  upon it, as ἢ [τις] τᾶς ἀσώτου Σισυφιδᾶν γενεᾶς [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἢν γαμῇ ποτ᾽ αὐτὸς
  ἢ [τις] τῶν ξυγγενῶν [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III Accentuation and position of τις:

  __A.III.1 accentuation: τις is normally enclitic, but in certain uses is orthotone,
  i.e. theoretically oxytone (τίς, τινά, τινές, τινῶν, etc.,[Refs 4th c.AD+] or τις,
  τινὰ, τινὲς, τινῶν, etc.). According to [Refs]

  __A.III.1.a at the beginning of a sentence, τίς ἔνδον..; is any one within? [Refs
  4th c.BC+]; τί φημ; ={λέγω τι}; am I saying anything? [Refs 5th c.BC+]; <τίς ἦλθ;>
  ἦλθέ τις has anybody come? [Refs 2nd c.BC+]; τὶς κάθηται, τὶς περιπατεῖ, so and
  so is sitting (walking), [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; τὶς αἰπόλος καλούμενος Κομάτας [Refs
  5th c.BC+]; τι οὖν (τὶς ἂν εἴποι) ταῦτα λέγει; [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __A.III.1.b when τις is opposed to to another τις or to some other word, τισὶ μὲν
  συμφέρει, τισὶ δ᾽ οὐ συμφέρει [Refs 5th c.BC+] for a certain person, [Refs 5th c.BC+].
  Codices are not consistent; in signification[Refs] they make it enclitic; in signification
  [Refs]; sometimes enclitic and orthotone in the same sentence, πάντα δὲ τὰ γιγνόμενα
  ὑπό τέ τινος γίγνεται καὶ ἔκ τινος καὶ τί [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2 position:

  __A.III.2.a τις is rarely first word in the sentence, and rarely follows a pause
  (see. above [Refs]; it may stand second word, ἔσκε τις ἐνθάδε μάντις ἀνήρ [Refs
  8th c.BC+]; but in general its position is not far before or after the word to which
  it belongs in sense, ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε δή τινα μάντιν ἐρείομεν [Refs]

  __A.III.2.b in Ionic dialect Prose it sometimes stands between its genitive and
  the Article of that genitive, τῶν τις Περσέων [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so also in late
  Prose, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]

  __A.III.2.c it stands between the Article and substantive in signification[Refs
  5th c.BC+]

  __A.III.2.d τίς τι is the correct order, not τί τις, “IG” 12.110.46, 5th c.BC: Thucydides
  Historicus 7.10, 5th-6th c.BC: Xenophon Historicus “Anabasis” 4.1.14 (codices dett.),
  4th c.BC: Demosthenes Orator 22.22, etc.

  __A.III.2.e whereas in _Attic dialect_ the order ἐάν τις is compulsory, in _Doric
  dialect_ the usual order is αἴ τίς κα, [Refs 5th c.BC+]: later Doric dialect εἴ
  τί κα [Refs]; καἴ τι ἂν (={καὶ εἴ τι ἂν}) [Refs 1st c.BC+], see below [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]:—this Doric dialect order influenced the Koine, as in the rare εἴ τις ἂν
  [Refs 1st c.AD+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
