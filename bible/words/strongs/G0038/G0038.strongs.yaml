  (ἁγιάζω), [in LXX: Eze.45:4 (מִקְדָּשׁ), Sir.7:31, etc. ;]

  as an active verbal noun in -μός, it signifies properly the process τὸ ἁγιάζειν,
  rather than the resultant state, ἁγιωσύνη, hence,

  __1. consecration;

  __2. sanctification: so strictly in Rom.6:19,22 (but see Meyer), 1Co.1:30, 1Th.4:3,7,
  2Th.2:13, Heb.12:14, 1Pe.1:2. Elsewhere it perhaps (Ellic.; but see Milligan, Th.,
  48) inclines to the resultant state: 1Th.4:4, 1Ti.2:15 (Cremer, 55, 602).
