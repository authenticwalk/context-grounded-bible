  SYN.: τιμωρία, requital. Arist. distinguishes between κ . as that which, being disciplinary,
  has reference to the sufferer, and τ. as that which, being penal, has reference
  to the satisfaction of him who inflicts (see Thayer, see word κ., and cf. Tr., Syn.,
  § vii). But in late Gk. especially, the distinction is not always maintained (see
  reff. in Thayer)  (AS) {STEPBible-TBESG}'
