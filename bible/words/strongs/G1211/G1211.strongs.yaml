  properly a temporal Particle (compare ἤδη), at this or that point: hence, now, then,
  already, or at length:

  __I in Epic dialect (rarely Lyric poetry) sometimes at the beginning of a sentence
  or clause, Τεῦκρε πέπον, δὴ νῶϊν ἀπέκτατο πιστὸς ἑταῖρος [Refs 8th c.BC+], frequently
  with Numerals and temporal Particles, ὀκτὼ δὴ προέηκα.. ὀϊστούς [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  ἐννέα δὴ βεβάασι.. ἐνιαυτοί full nine years, [Refs]; ἕκτον δὲ δὴ τόδ᾽ ἦμαρ this
  is just the sixth day, [Refs 8th c.BC+] many a time and oft, often ere now,[Refs
  5th c.BC+]; πάλαι δή, Latin jamdudum, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; νῦν δή just now, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; now at length, [Refs]; τότε δή at that very time, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; αὐτίκα
  δὴ μάλα this very instant, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ὕστερον δή yet later, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II without temporal significance, as a Particle of emphasis, in fact, of course,
  certainly, ναὶ δή, ἦ δή, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οὐ δή surely not, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; δῆλα
  δή, see at {δῆλος}; with Verbs, δὴ γὰρ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσι [Refs 8th c.BC+] they call
  the man a sophist as you know, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; γὰρ δή for manifestly, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]participle representing Conjunction and Verb, ἅτε δὴ ἐόντες since they evidently
  are, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; but ὡς φόνον νίζουσα δή as though she were.., [Refs 8th c.BC+];
  also ἵνα δή.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also εἰσήγαγε τὰς ἑταιρίδας δή the pretended courtesans,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; οὗτος δὴ ὁ Σωκράτης, ironically, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τὸ λεγόμενον

  of, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; οἷος δὴ σύ just such as thou, [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  5th c.BC+][near the start]; ποῦ δ; πῇ δ;[Refs 8th c.BC+] others be they who they
  may, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; μηδεὶς δή no one at all, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; δή τις some one

  __IV.2 to continue a narrative, frequently after μέν, then, so, τότε μὲν δὴ.. ἡσυχίην
  εἶχε [Refs 5th c.BC+] Latin haec hactenus, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in summing up numbers,
  γίγνονται δὴ οὗτοι χίλιοι these then amount to [Refs]; in resuming after a parenthesis,
  Ἀνδρομάχη, θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος Ἠετίωνος.., τοῦ περ δὴ θυγάτηρ [Refs 8th c.BC+]

  __IV.2.b with imperative and subjunctive, μὴ δὴ.. ἐπιέλπεο [Refs 8th c.BC+]; ἐννοεῖτε
