etymology: 'τοιοῦτος, αύτη, οῦτο,

  Attic dialect also -οῦτον[Refs 5th c.BC+], which is the Epic dialect form (see.
  [Refs 8th c.BC+], and seems to prevail in [Refs 5th c.BC+]: both forms occur in
  Papyrus, τοιοῦτον [Refs 5th c.BC+]:—Aeolic dialect τέουτος [Refs 7th c.BC+] —a stronger
  form of τοῖος, bearing the same relation to τοιόσδε as οὗτος to ὅδε, such as this,
  in [Refs 8th c.BC+] but in Attic dialect the most common of the three forms; antecedent
  to οἷος, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; to ὡς, [Refs 8th c.BC+]; to ὅς, ὅς, ὅσπερ, [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; to οἷόσπερ, see reading in [Refs 5th c.BC+]; less frequently to a conjunction,
  as ὥστε, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; frequently with implications, so good, so noble, so bad,
  etc., [Refs 8th c.BC+]; τοιοῦτον.. ἐστὶ τὸ.. τέλειον ἄνδρα εἶναι so great a thing
  is it.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; τοιοῦτος ὤν being such a wretch, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; εἴς
  τι τοιοῦτον ἐμπίπτειν οὗ.. into such a condition in which.., [Refs 5th c.BC+]; frequently
  coupled with τοσοῦτος, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; with οὗτος, [Refs 5th c.BC+] just as he
  (she, it) is, of slaves or animals for sale, [Refs 2nd c.AD+]; εἰς σὲ τοιοῦτος ἐγένετο,
  τ. γίγνου περὶ τοὺς γονεῖς, so disposed towards.., [Refs 5th c.BC+] such in thy
  words, [Refs 5th c.BC+] such another, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; ἕτερα τοιαῦτα, ἕτερον τοιοῦτον,
  [Refs]; referring to what precedes, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; used instead of repeating
  an adjective, ἀθάνατος εἶναι καὶ στρατιῆς τ. ἄρχειν [Refs 5th c.BC+]: with the Article,
  οἱ τοιοῦτοι [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __2 the sense is made more indefinite in τοιοῦτός τις or τις τοιοῦτος such a one,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]; in this case it may frequently be rendered by an adverb, ἡ διάρριψις
  τοιαύτη τις ἐγένετο took place in this wise, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __3 τὸτ. such a proceeding, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; διὰ τὸ τ. for such a reason, [Refs];
  ἐν τῷ τ. in such a case, [Refs]such a place, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; also ἐν τ. εἶναι
  τοῦ κινδύνου to be in such a state of peril, [Refs]

  __4 in narrative, τοιαῦτα properly refers to what goes before, τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ ταῦτα
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __4.b after a question, τοιαῦτα affirms like{ταῦτα} (see. οὗτος with VII.1), just
  so, even so, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __5 τοιαῦτα absolutely, τἂ πλοῖα, τὰ τοιαῦτα ships and suchlike, [Refs 4th c.BC+]

  __6 τοιαῦτα as adverb, in such wise, [Refs 5th c.BC+] adverb τοιούτως only late,
  [Refs] —Cf. τοσοῦτος. [τοῐ- frequently in Trag. and Comedy texts, e.g. [Refs 5th
  c.BC+]; compare τοιόσδε near the end] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
