  of a line, also in [Refs 8th c.BC+]; but ῐ in [Refs 8th c.BC+].]:—forebode, presage,

  be supplied from the context, διωκέμεναι γὰρ ὀΐω I fear [they] are pursuing me,

  γέμει σωφροσύνη; [Refs]

  __IV.2 expressive of modesty or courtesy, to avoid over-great bluntness of assertion,
  [Refs 5th c.BC+]: even between a preposition and its case, ἐξ οἶμαι τῆς ἀκροτάτης

  οἴομαι δὲ δεῖν οὐδέν methinks there is no need, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; must we not either
