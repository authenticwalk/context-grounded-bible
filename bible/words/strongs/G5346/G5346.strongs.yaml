  of an opponent''s objection, [Refs 1st c.AD+]; “τὸν δὲ μετ᾽ εἰσενόησα, ἔφη Ὅμηρος
  as H. said, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.2 joined with a synonymous Verb, ἔφη λέγων, ἔφησε λέγων, [Refs 5th c.BC+];
  λέγει οὐδέν, φαμένη.. [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.3 in repeating dialogues the Verb commonly goes before its subject, ἔφην ἐγώ,
  ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, said I, said [Refs 5th c.BC+] I said, [Refs 5th c.BC+] said.

  __II.4 inserted parenthetically, though the sentence has been introduced by λέγει,
  εἶπεν, etc., ὁ Ἰσχόμαχος.. εἶπεν· ἀλλὰ παίζεις μὲν σύ γε, ἔφη [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.5 τί φημ; [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __II.6 κυριώτατα φάναι, in parenthesis, strictly speaking, [Refs 1st c.AD+]; ὡς
  οὕτω φάναι, ={ὡς εἰπεῖν, ἅπασαι ὡς οὕτω φάναι} practically all, [Refs 2nd c.AD+];

  ἢ μὴ ἃ ἐρωτῶ answer me yes or no, [Refs 5th c.BC+]; so in answers, φημί or οὕτως
  φημί yes, [Refs]; οὐκ ἔφη he said no, [Refs] — In this sense _Attic dialect_ writers,
  besides present, mostly use future φήσω and aorist ἔφησα, but in imperfect, infinitive,
  and participle present, to avoid ambiguity, they prefer ἔφασκον, φάσκειν, φάσκων
  (see. φάσκω): φάναι is distinguished from φάσκειν, e.g. ἔφη σπουδάζειν he said he
  was in haste, ἔφασκε σπουδάζειν he alleged he was in haste; but ἔφησθα is found
  in this sense, [Refs 5th c.BC+]

  __IV command, order, ἔφην τῷ Ὀρθοβούλῳ ἐξαλεῖψαί με [Refs 5th c.BC+] {STEPBible-TFLSJ}'
