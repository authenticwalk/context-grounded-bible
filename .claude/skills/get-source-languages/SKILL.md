# Get Source Languages

## Overview

Retrieve detailed source language (Greek/Hebrew) data for Bible verses, including original text, morphology, Strong's dictionary entries, and semantic information. This skill combines Macula linguistic datasets with Strong's dictionary to provide comprehensive word-level analysis.

**New:** Also supports direct Strong's number lookups and searching for English words to find all Greek and Hebrew variants (e.g., search "love" to find G0025, G5368, H0157).

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User wants to study Greek or Hebrew words in a verse
- User asks about original language meanings or etymology
- User needs morphological analysis (tense, case, gender, etc.)
- User is doing word studies or comparative analysis
- User mentions "Greek", "Hebrew", "original language", "source text", or "Strong's"
- User asks about a Strong's number directly (e.g., "What is G0025?")
- User asks about English words and their Greek/Hebrew equivalents (e.g., "Greek words for love")

Do NOT use this skill when:
- User only wants English translations (use quote-bible skill)
- User is doing topical study without language focus
- User needs commentary rather than linguistic data

## How to Use

There are two main modes: **verse-based lookup** and **Strong's number/word lookup**.

### Mode A: Verse-Based Lookup

Use when analyzing a specific Bible verse.

#### Step 1: Parse the Bible Reference

Extract the Bible reference from the user's request. The reference must use USFM 3.0 three-letter codes:
- **Book code**: Use USFM 3.0 (e.g., "JHN", "GEN", "MAT")
- **Chapter:Verse format**: "JHN 3:16", "GEN 1:1"

#### Step 2: Execute the Source Languages Fetcher

Use the Bash tool to execute the fetcher script:

```bash
python3 /home/user/context-grounded-bible/src/lib/source_languages_fetcher.py "<reference>"
```

Where `<reference>` is the verse reference:
- "JHN 3:16" (John 3:16)
- "GEN 1:1" (Genesis 1:1)
- "ROM 8:28" (Romans 8:28)

#### Step 3: Display Results

The script returns YAML data containing:
- **verse**: Verse reference
- **language**: Source language (heb/grc)
- **text**: Original language text
- **words**: Array of word objects with:
  - `text`: Original language word
  - `lemma`: Dictionary form
  - `morphology`: Grammatical properties (pos, case, tense, gender, number, etc.)
  - `translation`: English gloss
  - `strongs_data`: Full Strong's dictionary entry merged from all sources
  - `lexical`: Strong's number references
  - `semantic`: Semantic domain information

Present the information clearly to the user, highlighting:
- Original text with transliteration
- Strong's numbers and definitions
- Morphological information relevant to their question
- English glosses for understanding

#### Options

Optional flags:
- `--output <file>`: Save results to a YAML file
- `--json`: Output as JSON instead of YAML
- `--no-generate`: Don't auto-generate Macula data if missing

### Mode B: Strong's Number/Word Lookup

Use when studying specific Strong's numbers or English words.

#### Step 1: Execute get_strongs.py

Use the Bash tool to execute:

**Lookup by Strong's numbers:**
```bash
python3 /home/user/context-grounded-bible/src/lib/get_strongs.py G0025 G5368 H0157
```

**Search by English word:**
```bash
python3 /home/user/context-grounded-bible/src/lib/get_strongs.py --word love
```

**Search multiple words:**
```bash
python3 /home/user/context-grounded-bible/src/lib/get_strongs.py --word love --word beloved
```

**Combined:**
```bash
python3 /home/user/context-grounded-bible/src/lib/get_strongs.py G0025 --word love
```

#### Step 2: Display Results

The script returns YAML data structured as:
```yaml
words:
  G0025:
    strongs_number: G0025
    language: greek
    lemma: ἀγαπάω
    transliteration: agapáō
    definition: to love (in a social or moral sense)
    kjv_usage: (be-)love(-ed)
    derivation: ...
  G5368:
    strongs_number: G5368
    ...
metadata:
  total_entries: 3
  greek_entries: 2
  hebrew_entries: 1
  search_words: [love]
```

Present the information clearly, highlighting:
- All Greek and Hebrew variants found
- Differences in meaning between similar words
- KJV usage patterns
- Etymological relationships

#### Options

Optional flags:
- `--output <file>`: Save results to a YAML file
- `--json`: Output as JSON instead of YAML
- `--case-sensitive`: Make word search case-sensitive

## Examples

### Verse-Based Examples

#### Example 1: Study Greek Words in John 3:16

**User:** "What are the Greek words in John 3:16?"

**Action:** Execute:
```bash
python3 /home/user/context-grounded-bible/src/lib/source_languages_fetcher.py "JHN 3:16"
```

**Expected behavior:** Display each Greek word with lemma, morphology, and Strong's definition

#### Example 2: Hebrew Word Study

**User:** "I want to study the Hebrew words in Genesis 1:1"

**Expected behavior:** Display G0025 and all other love-related entries from both Greek and Hebrew

## Technical Details

### Data Sources

The skill combines data from:
1. **Macula Project**: Morphologically analyzed Hebrew (WLC) and Greek (Nestle 1904) texts
   - Location: `./bible/commentaries/{BOOK}/{chapter}/{verse}/{BOOK}-{chapter}-{verse}-macula.yaml`
   - Contains: Original text, lemmas, morphology, syntax, semantic domains

2. **Strong's Dictionary**: Hebrew and Greek lexicon entries
   - Location: `./bible/words/strongs/{STRONG_NUMBER}/`
   - Contains: Lemma, definition, KJV usage, derivation, transliteration

### Auto-Generation

If Macula data doesn't exist for a verse, the script automatically:
1. Calls `macula_processor.py --verse "<reference>"`
2. Generates the macula.yaml file from cached XML datasets
3. Returns the newly generated data

This requires that Macula datasets have been downloaded via `macula_fetcher.py`.

### Data Merging

The skill uses `yaml_merger.py` to merge multiple YAML files:
- All files in a Strong's number directory are merged
- Nested merge preserves structure
- String values are concatenated if different
- Lists are extended

## Error Handling

If the script fails:
1. **"Macula data not found"**: Run `python3 src/lib/macula/macula_fetcher.py` first to download datasets
2. **"Strong's entry not found"**: Run `python3 strongs-fetcher.py` to download Strong's dictionary
3. **"Invalid verse reference"**: Check reference format (BOOK CHAPTER:VERSE)

## Integration with Tool Ecosystem

When the `tool-experimenter` skill is improving Bible study tools, it should consider this skill as an option if the tool:
- Deals with source language data
- Needs Strong's definitions
- Requires morphological analysis
- Works with Hebrew or Greek text

## Notes

- Greek text uses Unicode (polytonic Greek)
- Hebrew text uses Unicode (Hebrew with vowel points)
- Strong's numbers follow format: G0001-G5624 (Greek), H0001-H8674 (Hebrew)
- Morphology codes follow standard linguistic conventions (see Macula documentation)
