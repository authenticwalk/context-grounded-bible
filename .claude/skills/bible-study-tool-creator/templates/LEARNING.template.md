# Learning Log: {{TOOL_NAME}}

This file tracks experiments, hypotheses, results, and future directions for improving this tool.

## Purpose

The self-learning loop helps us continuously improve the quality of generated data by:
1. Testing the agent on sample verses
2. Analyzing output quality
3. Identifying weaknesses or missing insights
4. Refining the prompt template
5. Re-testing to verify improvements

## Format

Each experiment should include:
- **Date**: When the experiment was conducted
- **Hypothesis**: What you expected to happen
- **Approach**: What you tried
- **Result**: What actually happened
- **Learnings**: Insights gained
- **Status**: ✅ Successful | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Failed

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Initial Baseline ({{DATE}})

- **Hypothesis**: The initial template will provide useful data but may lack depth in {{SPECIFIC_AREA}}
- **Approach**: Run the template on {{TEST_VERSE}} and evaluate output against project goals
- **Result**: _(Pending - to be filled after first test run)_
- **Learnings**: _(To be documented)_
- **Status**: Pending

## Future Experiments

Track potential improvements to try:

- [ ] Test with verses containing complex Greek word relationships
- [ ] Experiment with different cultural contexts (Asian, African, South American)
- [ ] Validate theological accuracy with reference materials
- [ ] Test edge cases (poetry, prophecy, narrative, epistles)
- [ ] Compare output against existing commentaries
- [ ] Add more specific examples to prompt template
- [ ] {{CUSTOM_EXPERIMENT_1}}
- [ ] {{CUSTOM_EXPERIMENT_2}}

## Metrics for Success

We consider this tool successful when:

1. **Accuracy**: Output is factually correct and theologically sound
2. **Usefulness**: Data provides practical value to translators/pastors/students
3. **Consistency**: Similar verses produce appropriately similar outputs
4. **Completeness**: All relevant information is captured
5. **Uniqueness**: Provides insights not easily remembered by base LLMs

## Template Evolution

Track major template changes:

### Version 1.0 ({{DATE}})
- **Changes**: Initial template creation
- **Rationale**: Baseline implementation
- **Impact**: N/A (first version)
