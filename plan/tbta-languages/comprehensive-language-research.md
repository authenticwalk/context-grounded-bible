# TBTA Cross-Linguistic Features: Comprehensive Language Research

## Purpose
This document provides detailed language examples for each TBTA linguistic feature, plus additional features TBTA may not have explicitly considered. Use this to build the language feature database.

---

## PART 1: TBTA Features (Features Found in TBTA Data)

### 1. NUMBER SYSTEMS

#### 1.1 Trial Number (Exactly 3 Items)

**Definition:** Grammatical number referring to exactly three things (as opposed to singular, dual, or plural).

**Key Insight:** No language has trial unless it has dual; no language has dual unless it has singular/plural. Trial is rare and almost exclusively confined to pronouns in Oceanic languages.

**Languages with True Trial:**

| Language | Code | Family | Location | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Larike** | lar | Austronesian (Central Moluccan) | Indonesia | Described as having "true trial" (Laidig) |
| **Marshallese** | mah | Austronesian (Micronesian) | Marshall Islands | Has singular, dual, trial, and two plural forms (5+ and 2+) |
| **Manam** | mva | Austronesian (Oceanic) | Papua New Guinea | Trial in pronouns |
| **Tok Pisin** | tpi | Creole (English-based) | Papua New Guinea | Trial pronouns: mitripela, yutripela |
| **Bislama** | bis | Creole (English-based) | Vanuatu | yutrifala (trial: you three) |
| **Biak** | bhw | Austronesian (South Halmahera-West New Guinea) | Indonesia | Trial pronouns |
| **Tolomako** | - | Austronesian (Oceanic) | Vanuatu | Trial in pronouns |

**Languages with "Greater Paucal" (minimum 3, not exactly 3):**

| Language | Code | Family | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| **Lihir** | lih | Austronesian (Oceanic) | PNG - 5-way: singular, dual, trial, paucal, plural |
| **Sursurunga** | sgz | Austronesian (Oceanic) | PNG - Reanalyzed as paucal (min 3) + greater paucal (min 4+) |
| **Mussau** | mva | Austronesian (Oceanic) | PNG - Dual, trial, paucal in pronouns |

**eBible Coverage:** Check for kil (Kilivila if available), mah (Marshallese), tpi (Tok Pisin), bis (Bislama)

**TBTA Usage:** Genesis 1:26 marks God as "Trial" (Trinity = 3 persons)

---

#### 1.2 Dual Number (Exactly 2 Items)

**Definition:** Grammatical number referring to precisely two entities acting as a single unit or in unison.

**Languages with Dual:**

| Language | Code | Family | Location | Scope |
|----------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Slovene** | slv | Indo-European (Slavic) | Slovenia | Full dual (nouns, verbs, adjectives) |
| **Arabic (MSA)** | arb | Afro-Asiatic (Semitic) | Middle East | Compulsory with all count nouns (add -ān/-ain) |
| **Hebrew (Modern)** | heb | Afro-Asiatic (Semitic) | Israel | Atrophied - only time/number/body parts |
| **Sorbian** | hsb/dsb | Indo-European (Slavic) | Germany | Both Upper and Lower Sorbian |
| **Scottish Gaelic** | gla | Indo-European (Celtic) | Scotland | Dual in some forms |
| **Sami languages** | Multiple | Uralic | Northern Scandinavia | Various Sami languages have dual |

**Slovene Examples:**
- Nouns: "dve knjigi" (two books)
- Verbs: "midva prebirava" (we two argue), "onadva študirata" (they two study)
- Emphasis: "obe očesi me bolita" (both my eyes hurt) - the -ta ending shows dual

**Arabic Examples:**
- Adding -ān to nominative: kitābun (book) → kitābān (two books)
- Adding -ain to genitive/accusative: kitābaīn (two books)

**Hebrew Examples:**
- שעתיים (she'atayim) - two hours
- יומיים (yomayim) - two days
- שבועיים (shvu'ayim) - two weeks
- משפריים (misparayim) - scissors (always dual)
- אופניים (ofnayim) - bicycle (always dual)

**eBible Coverage:** Check arb (Arabic), heb (Hebrew), slv (Slovene)

---

#### 1.3 Quadrial Number (Exactly 4 Items)

**Definition:** Grammatical number referring to exactly four items. HIGHLY CONTESTED - many linguists consider these to be paucals (minimum 4) rather than true quadrials.

**Languages Claimed to Have Quadrial:**

| Language | Code | Family | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Marshallese** | mah | Austronesian (Micronesian) | Accepted by experts | Bender (2016) still calls it quadrial |
| **Sursurunga** | sgz | Austronesian (Oceanic) | Reanalyzed | Now considered "greater paucal" (min 4+) |

**Current Consensus:** Most linguists believe true quadrials don't exist in natural language; what were called "quadrial" are actually paucals with a minimum of 4.

**Marshallese Note:** The final 2016 reference grammar by Byron W. Bender still refers to Marshallese as having a quadrial, creating a six-way number distinction: singular, dual, trial, quadrial, plural (5+), and plural (2+).

**eBible Coverage:** Check mah (Marshallese)

---

#### 1.4 Paucal Number (A Few, Small Number)

**Definition:** Grammatical number representing "a few," a small inexactly numbered group (typically 3-10 or 3-15, varies by language).

**Languages with Paucal:**

| Language | Code | Family | Location | Range |
|----------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Murrinh-patha** | mwf | Southern Daly | Northern Territory, Australia | 3-15 individuals |
| **Lihir** | lih | Austronesian | Papua New Guinea | Distinct from trial |
| **Sursurunga** | sgz | Austronesian | Papua New Guinea | Paucal (smaller groups ~3-4) + greater paucal (4+) |
| **Mussau** | mva | Austronesian | Papua New Guinea | In pronouns |
| **Arabana** | ard | Pama-Nyungan | Australia | Has "true trial" (Hercus) distinct from paucal |
| **Barngarla** | bjb | Pama-Nyungan | Australia | 4-way: singular, dual, plural, superplural |

**Murrinh-patha Example:** 4-way system with 31 total pronouns
- Singular: 1 person
- Dual: 2 persons
- Paucal: 3-15 persons
- Plural: more than 15 persons

**Geographic Distribution:** Paucal is most common in Australian Aboriginal languages (various families) and some Oceanic languages.

**eBible Coverage:** Check for Australian Aboriginal languages (limited in eBible)

---

### 2. PERSON SYSTEMS (Clusivity)

#### 2.1 Inclusive vs. Exclusive First Person

**Definition:** Grammatical distinction in first-person plural pronouns between inclusive "we" (speaker + addressee) vs. exclusive "we" (speaker + others, but NOT addressee).

**Global Distribution:** ~40% of world's languages have this distinction. Found in:
- Dravidian, Kartvelian, Caucasian languages
- Australian languages (widespread)
- Austronesian languages (widespread)
- Languages of eastern, southern, southwestern Asia
- Many Native American languages
- Some creole languages
- NO European languages outside the Caucasus

**Languages with Inclusive/Exclusive:**

| Language | Code | Family | Inclusive | Exclusive | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Tagalog** | tgl | Austronesian | tayo | kami | Grammatically required |
| **Malay** | zsm | Austronesian | kita | kami | "Kita pergi" = we [you+I] went |
| **Indonesian** | ind | Austronesian | kita | kami | Same as Malay |
| **Fijian** | fij | Austronesian | keitou | keimami | Distinction maintained |
| **Quechua** | que | Quechuan | - | - | Has inclusive/exclusive |
| **Guaraní** | grn | Tupian | - | - | Has inclusive/exclusive |
| **Marshallese** | mah | Austronesian | - | - | Distinguishes in ALL number categories |

**Example Usage:**

Malay/Indonesian:
- "Kami pergi" = "We [not you] went" (exclusive)
- "Kita pergi" = "We [you and I] went" (inclusive)

Tagalog:
- "Tayo ay pumunta" = "We [including you] went" (inclusive)
- "Kami ay pumunta" = "We [excluding you] went" (exclusive)

**Biblical Relevance:**

Genesis 1:26: "Let US create..." - TBTA marks as "First Inclusive"
- In Tagalog: Use "tayo" (inclusive) because Trinity members are addressing each other
- In languages without this distinction, the precision is lost

Acts 15:25: "It seemed good to us..." (apostles speaking to congregation)
- TBTA would mark as "First Exclusive" (apostles, not congregation)
- Tagalog would use "kami" (exclusive)

**eBible Coverage:** Check tgl, ind, zsm, fij, grn, que (extensive coverage expected)

---

#### 2.2 First as Third, Second as Third

**TBTA Values:** `First as Third`, `Second as Third`, `First Inclusive as Third`, `First Exclusive as Third`

**Definition:** Pronouns that grammatically act as third person while semantically referring to first or second person. Often used for:
- Honorific avoidance of direct reference
- Royal "we" or majestic plural
- Humble self-reference
- Respectful indirect reference

**Languages with Person-Shifting:**

| Language | Code | Feature | Example |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **Thai** | tha | Royalty uses 1st as 3rd | Royalty refers to self in 3rd person |
| **Japanese** | jpn | Humble reference | Using names instead of pronouns |
| **Korean** | kor | Honorific avoidance | Using titles instead of "you" |
| **Javanese** | jav | Respect levels | Different pronoun sets by status |
| **Malay** | zsm | Royal reference | Sultan uses 3rd person for self |

**Research Needed:** More specific documentation of TBTA's "First as Third" and "Second as Third" categories.

**eBible Coverage:** Check tha, jpn, kor, jav for patterns

---

### 3. PROXIMITY / DEMONSTRATIVE SYSTEMS

#### 3.1 Two-Way Systems (Near vs. Far)

**Languages:**
- English: this/that
- Most European languages
- Standard Chinese: zhè (this) / nà (that)

#### 3.2 Three-Way Systems (Near Speaker / Near Listener / Far from Both)

**Distribution:** Common in many language families. The systems can be:
- **Person-oriented:** Based on proximity to speaker vs. listener
- **Distance-oriented:** Based purely on spatial distance

**Languages with 3-Way Systems:**

| Language | Code | Proximal (Near Speaker) | Medial (Near Listener) | Distal (Far from Both) | Type |
|----------|------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------|
| **Japanese** | jpn | これ kore | それ sore | あれ are | Person-oriented |
| **Korean** | kor | 이 i / 이것 igeot | 그 geu / 그것 geugeot | 저 jeo / 저것 jeogeot | Person-oriented |
| **Spanish** | spa | este | ese | aquel | Person-oriented |
| **Portuguese** | por | este | esse | aquele | Person-oriented |
| **Italian** | ita | questo | codesto | quello | Person-oriented |
| **Turkish** | tur | bu | şu | o | Person + attention |
| **Georgian** | kat | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Armenian** | hye | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Serbo-Croatian** | hrv/srp | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Macedonian** | mkd | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Basque** | eus | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Ukrainian** | ukr | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Bengali** | ben | - | - | - | 3-way system |
| **Tamil (Sri Lankan)** | tam | - | - | - | 3-way system |

**Japanese Ko-So-A-Do System:**
- これ (kore) - this (near me, the speaker)
- それ (sore) - that (near you, the listener)
- あれ (are) - that (over there, far from both)
- どれ (dore) - which? (question form)

**Korean System:**
- 이 / 이것 - close to speaker
- 그 / 그것 - away from speaker, near listener
- 저 / 저것 - away from both

**Spanish System:**
- este/esta/estos/estas - this (near me)
- ese/esa/esos/esas - that (near you)
- aquel/aquella/aquellos/aquellas - that (over there)

**Turkish Special Feature:** Encodes both distance AND whether addressee's visual attention is on the referent.

**eBible Coverage:** Check jpn, kor, spa, por, ita, tur, kat, hye, eus, tam

---

#### 3.3 Four+ Way Systems (Rare)

**Note:** 4+ term demonstrative systems are cross-linguistically uncommon and almost always person-oriented.

**Documented Examples:**
- Some Native American languages: Near me / Near you / Near us both / Remote visible / Remote invisible
- Some Papua New Guinea languages

**Research Needed:** Specific language names and codes for 4+ way systems in eBible.

---

#### 3.4 TBTA Proximity Categories

TBTA encodes these proximity distinctions:
- `Near Speaker and Listener` - Both in proximity
- `Near Speaker` - Speaker's vicinity
- `Near Listener` - Listener's vicinity
- `Remote within Sight` - Visible but distant
- `Remote out of Sight` - Not visible
- `Temporally Near` - Recent in time
- `Temporally Remote` - Distant in time
- `Contextually Near` - In current discourse context
- `Contextually Near with Focus` - In context + emphasized

**Mapping Task:** Map TBTA categories to actual demonstrative systems in translation languages.

---

### 4. TIME GRANULARITY / TENSE SYSTEMS

#### 4.1 Languages with Complex Temporal Distance Systems

**Bantu Languages (Most Studied):**

Bantu languages are famous for complex tense systems encoding multiple degrees of temporal remoteness from the speech event.

**Key Research:** Botne & Kershner (2008) - "Tense and Cognitive Space"
- Proposes multi-dimensional temporal domains (not single timeline)
- Distinguishes contemporal (present) vs. dissociated domains (past/future)
- Accounts for immediate vs. non-immediate domains
- Explains temporal overlap of tenses

**Languages with Graded Tense:**

| Language | Code | Family | Temporal Distinctions | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Swahili** | swh | Niger-Congo (Bantu) | Multiple past/future distances | Well-documented complex system |
| **Zulu** | zul | Niger-Congo (Bantu) | Multiple remoteness levels | Bantu tense prototype |
| **Kĩmwĩmbĩ** | - | Niger-Congo (Bantu) | Complex tense/aspect | Research available |
| **Quechua** | que | Quechuan | Time + evidentiality | Combines time distance with source |
| **Tagalog** | tgl | Austronesian | Multiple past forms | Immediate vs. remote past |

**TBTA Time Granularity Values:**

| TBTA Value | Approximate Distance | Languages Likely to Require |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| `Immediate Past` | Just now, moments ago | Bantu, Tagalog, Quechua |
| `Earlier Today` | Hours ago (same day) | Bantu, Tagalog |
| `Yesterday` | 1 day ago | Many languages mark specifically |
| `2 Days Ago` | - | Some Bantu languages |
| `3 Days Ago` | - | Some Bantu languages |
| `A Week Ago` | Recent past | Bantu languages |
| `A Month Ago` | - | Bantu languages |
| `A Year Ago` | - | Bantu languages |
| `Historic Past` | Ancient times | Bantu, narrative tenses |
| `During Speaker's Lifetime` | Personal experience | Evidential languages |
| `Immediate Future` | About to happen | Bantu, Tagalog |
| `Later Today` | Soon (same day) | Bantu, Tagalog |
| `Tomorrow` | 1 day future | Many languages mark specifically |
| `A Year from Now` | Distant future | Bantu languages |
| `Unknown Future` | Indefinite future | Many languages |
| `Discourse` | Timeless/gnomic | Many languages |
| `Present` | Right now | Universal |

**eBible Coverage:** Check swh, zul, tgl, que for temporal marking patterns

---

### 5. SPEAKER DEMOGRAPHICS / HONORIFICS / POLITENESS SYSTEMS

#### 5.1 Languages with Grammatical Honorifics

**Definition:** Languages where politeness/honorifics are grammatically encoded, affecting morphology, not just lexicon.

**Highly Developed Grammatical Systems:**

| Language | Code | Politeness Levels | Description |
|----------|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Japanese** | jpn | ~4 main levels + variations | Affects verb endings, pronouns, vocabulary |
| **Korean** | kor | 7 speech levels | Highly complex, affects all speech |

**Other Languages with Grammatical Honorifics:**

| Language | Code | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| **Javanese** | jav | 3-5 levels | Ngoko (low), Madya (mid), Krama (high) |
| **Balinese** | ban | 3 main levels | Similar to Javanese |
| **Thai** | tha | Lexical primarily | Particles, pronouns by status |
| **Vietnamese** | vie | Complex pronouns | Pronoun system based on age/relationship |
| **Hindi/Urdu** | hin/urd | 3 levels | तू tu / तुम tum / आप aap |
| **Burmese** | mya | Lexical | Honorific vocabulary |
| **Tibetan** | bod | Lexical | Honorific vocabulary |

**Japanese System:**

Basic levels:
1. **Plain form** (casual): 食べる taberu - eat
2. **Polite form** (です/ます): 食べます tabemasu - eat (polite)
3. **Honorific form** (respect to subject): お食べになる otabe ni naru
4. **Humble form** (respect to object): いただく itadaku

Nothing can be expressed in Japanese without simultaneously expressing politeness level related to speakers' sexes, ages, relative status, and degree of intimacy.

**Korean Speech Levels** (하십시오체 to 해라체):
1. 하십시오체 (hasipsioche) - Formal polite
2. 하오체 (haoche) - Formal
3. 하게체 (hageche) - Semi-formal
4. 해요체 (haeyoche) - Informal polite
5. 해체 (haeche) - Informal casual
6. 하라체 (harache) - Plain
7. 반말 (banmal) - Intimate/casual

Age and relationship are absolutely required to choose the correct level.

**Javanese Speech Levels:**
- **Ngoko** (low, intimate): Used between close friends, to inferiors
- **Madya** (middle): Polite but not formal
- **Krama** (high, respectful): Used to superiors, formal contexts
- Some sources identify 5 levels with sub-variations

**TBTA Speaker Demographics Fields:**

- `Speaker's Age`: Young Adult (18-24), Adult (25-49), Elder (50+)
- `Speaker-Listener Age`: Same Age, Older, Younger, Different Generation
- `Speaker's Attitude`: Neutral, Familiar, Honorable/Respectful
- `Speech Style`: Formal, Informal

**Biblical Example:**

Genesis 19:31 - Older sister to younger sister:
```yaml
Speaker's Age: Young Adult (18-24)
Speaker-Listener Age: Essentially the Same Age
Speaker's Attitude: Familiar
```

**Translation Implications:**
- Japanese: Use casual form よ (yo) ending
- Korean: Use 반말 (banmal - informal speech)
- Javanese: Use Ngoko (intimate level)
- Thai: Use informal particles
- Vietnamese: Use casual pronouns

**eBible Coverage:** Check jpn, kor, jav, tha, vie, hin

---

### 6. SWITCH-REFERENCE / PARTICIPANT TRACKING

#### 6.1 Switch-Reference Languages

**Definition:** Clause-level morphemes signaling whether arguments in adjacent clauses are coreferential. Basic distinction: Same Subject (SS) vs. Different Subject (DS).

**Global Distribution:**
- Papua New Guinea: 72% of surveyed languages (122 out of 169)
- North America: Hundreds of languages
- South America: Many languages (Quechua, etc.)
- Australia: Some Aboriginal languages
- South Pacific: Some Oceanic languages

**Languages with Switch-Reference:**

| Language | Code | Family | Location | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Quechua** | que | Quechuan | Andes | Well-documented SR system |
| **Navajo** | nav | Na-Dené | SW USA | Complex SR marking |
| **Wojokeso** | wbk | Trans-New Guinea | Papua New Guinea | Detailed SR study available |
| **Guanano** | gvc | Tucanoan | Colombia/Brazil | Compared with PNG languages |
| **Amele** | aey | Trans-New Guinea | Papua New Guinea | Classic SR example |

**Papua New Guinea:**
- Over 40 language families have SR
- 7 distinct morphological strategies identified
- Primarily Trans-New Guinea phylum
- Clustered in central highlands

**TBTA Participant Tracking Values:**

TBTA encodes entity flow through discourse:
- `First Mention` - Newly introduced entity
- `Routine` - Established participant (dominant value)
- `Integration` - Being integrated into narrative
- `Exiting` - Leaving the narrative
- `Restaging` - Reintroduced after absence
- `Offstage` - Not present in scene
- `Generic` - Generic reference
- `Interrogative` - Question element
- `Frame Inferable` - Can be inferred from context

**Mapping:** TBTA's participant tracking aligns with SR languages' need to track subject continuity/change.

**eBible Coverage:** Check que (Quechua), nav (Navajo if available), wbk, gvc, aey (PNG languages - limited eBible coverage)

---

### 7. NOUN LIST INDEX / ENTITY DISAMBIGUATION

**TBTA Feature:** Uses 1-9, A-Z, a-z (62 possible entities per verse) to track which nouns refer to the same entity.

**Relevant Language Types:**

#### 7.1 Pro-Drop Languages (Pronoun-Dropping)

Languages that allow pronouns to be omitted when context makes them clear:

| Language | Code | Family | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| **Japanese** | jpn | Japonic | Extensive pro-drop |
| **Korean** | kor | Koreanic | Extensive pro-drop |
| **Spanish** | spa | Romance | Subject pro-drop |
| **Italian** | ita | Romance | Subject pro-drop |
| **Portuguese** | por | Romance | Subject pro-drop |
| **Chinese** | zho | Sino-Tibetan | Topic-prominent, pro-drop |
| **Turkish** | tur | Turkic | Pro-drop |
| **Hindi** | hin | Indo-Aryan | Pro-drop |
| **Thai** | tha | Kra-Dai | Pro-drop |

**Why Entity Tracking Matters:** In pro-drop languages, explicit nouns may only appear once, then be dropped. Clear entity tracking (via TBTA's Noun List Index) helps translators know which dropped pronoun refers to which entity.

**Example:** Genesis 4:8 - "Cain said to Abel his brother, and he rose up and he killed him"
- Which "he" is which?
- TBTA Noun List Index: Cain = 1, Abel = 2, brother = 2 (same as Abel)
- Helps pro-drop languages know when to reintroduce nouns for clarity

**eBible Coverage:** Check jpn, kor, spa, ita, por, zho, tur, hin, tha

---

## PART 2: Features TBTA May Not Have Explicitly Considered

### 1. EVIDENTIALITY (Source of Knowledge Marking)

**Definition:** Linguistic encoding of the source of evidence for a statement (witnessed, hearsay, inference, etc.).

**Why It Matters:** In evidential languages, speakers MUST mark whether information is firsthand or secondhand. Omitting evidential markers makes sentences ungrammatical.

**Languages with Obligatory Evidentiality:**

| Language | Code | Family | System Type | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Turkish** | tur | Turkic | Direct vs. Indirect | -di (witnessed) vs. -miş (unwitnessed) |
| **Quechua** | que | Quechuan | Complex evidential | Direct/indirect/reportative |
| **Tibetan** | bod | Sino-Tibetan | Evidential | Required marking |
| **Bulgarian** | bul | Slavic | Evidential | Renarrative mood |
| **Korean** | kor | Koreanic | Some evidential | Optional in modern Korean |
| **Tariana** | tae | Arawakan | Complex evidential | 5 evidential categories |

**Turkish System:**
- -di suffix: Direct experience ("I saw it happen")
- -miş suffix: Indirect (hearsay or inference: "I heard it happened" or "apparently it happened")

**Quechua System:**
- Direct evidential: Speaker witnessed the event
- Reportative: Speaker heard about it (-si suffix)
- Inferential: Speaker infers from evidence

**Biblical Implications:**

Narrative texts: Did the author witness this? Is it passed-down history?
- Genesis creation: Would use indirect/reportative (Moses didn't witness it)
- Gospel accounts: Would use direct (eyewitness) or reportative (Luke's research)

**eBible Coverage:** Check tur, que, bod, bul, tae

**Recommendation for Tool:** Add evidentiality analysis to TBTA amplification tool as an additional feature layer.

---

### 2. ALIENABLE vs. INALIENABLE POSSESSION

**Definition:** Grammatical distinction between things that can be separated from their possessor (alienable: my book) vs. things that cannot (inalienable: my hand, my mother).

**Global Distribution:** 15-20% of world's languages have obligatory possession marking for inalienable nouns.

**Languages with Alienable/Inalienable:**

| Language | Code | Family | System |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Proto-Oceanic descendants** | Multiple | Austronesian | 3-4 possession categories |
| **Nahuatl** | nah | Uto-Aztecan | Inalienable possession |
| **K'iche (Mayan)** | quc | Mayan | Inalienable possession |
| **Tzutujil (Mayan)** | tzj | Mayan | Also has non-possessible nouns |
| **Araki** | akr | Austronesian | 4-way possessive classifiers |

**Oceanic Language System:**

Proto-Oceanic had:
- **Inalienable:** Directly possessed (body parts, kinship, part-whole)
- **Alienable:** Indirectly possessed with classifiers:
  - Food classifier
  - Valuable possessions classifier
  - Temporary possessions classifier
  - General classifier

**Biblical Implications:**

Body parts: "his hand," "their feet" - inalienable
Kinship: "his father," "her mother" - inalienable
Possessions: "his coat," "their house" - alienable

Languages with this distinction would require different grammatical structures depending on the noun type.

**eBible Coverage:** Check Oceanic languages (limited), nah, quc, tzj

**Recommendation:** Add possession type analysis to TBTA tool, especially for verses with body parts and kinship terms.

---

### 3. NOUN CLASSIFIERS / MEASURE WORDS

**Definition:** Obligatory words used when counting or specifying nouns, categorizing nouns by shape, animacy, function, etc.

**Languages with Obligatory Classifiers:**

| Language | Code | Family | Number of Classifiers | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Mandarin Chinese** | cmn | Sino-Tibetan | ~100+ | Compulsory with all count nouns |
| **Japanese** | jpn | Japonic | ~500+ | Required when counting |
| **Korean** | kor | Koreanic | ~100+ | Required with numerals |
| **Thai** | tha | Kra-Dai | ~100+ | Extensive system |
| **Vietnamese** | vie | Austroasiatic | ~100+ | Classifier system |
| **Bengali** | ben | Indo-Aryan | Several | Classifier system |
| **Burmese** | mya | Sino-Tibetan | ~100+ | Classifier system |
| **Yucatec Mayan** | yua | Mayan | Extensive | Obligatory classifiers |
| **Tzotzil Mayan** | tzo | Mayan | Extensive | Obligatory classifiers |

**System Types:**

**Mandarin Examples:**
- 一个人 (yī gè rén) - one [general classifier] person
- 两本书 (liǎng běn shū) - two [book classifier] books
- 三只狗 (sān zhī gǒu) - three [animal classifier] dogs

**Japanese Examples:**
- 一人 (hitori) - one person [people counter]
- 二匹 (nihiki) - two animals [small animal counter]
- 三本 (sanbon) - three [long cylindrical objects]

**Biblical Implications:**

Counting people: "twelve disciples" - classifier languages need appropriate counter
Counting objects: "two fish," "five loaves" - different classifiers for each
Animals: "ten camels" - animal classifier required

**eBible Coverage:** Check cmn, jpn, kor, tha, vie, ben, mya, yua, tzo

**Recommendation:** Add noun classifier analysis to TBTA tool, cataloging which nouns appear with numbers in each verse.

---

### 4. GENDER SYSTEMS (Beyond Masculine/Feminine)

**Note:** TBTA likely has some gender analysis, but may not cover rare systems.

**Unusual Gender Systems:**

| Language | Code | System |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Zulu** | zul | 15+ noun classes |
| **Swahili** | swh | 18 noun classes |
| **Dyirbal** | dbl | 4 genders (including "edible things") |

**Recommendation:** Verify TBTA's gender coverage; add if missing.

---

### 5. POLITENESS IN QUESTIONS / IMPERATIVES

**Languages with Grammatical Question/Command Politeness:**

Some languages have different grammatical forms for polite vs. casual questions and commands (beyond vocabulary choice).

**Examples:**
- Japanese: です/ます forms in questions
- Korean: Speech levels affect question endings
- Thai: Particles change politeness
- Javanese: Different question words by level

**Biblical Implications:**

Jesus's commands: How polite/authoritative?
Questions to religious leaders: Respectful or challenging?
Requests vs. commands: Grammatical distinction?

**Recommendation:** Analyze illocutionary force + speaker attitude combinations for politeness marking.

---

### 6. SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS

**Languages:** Common in Niger-Congo, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan languages.

**Why It Matters:** Some languages require multiple verbs in sequence where English uses one verb + preposition.

**Example:**
- English: "He took the book and left"
- Serial verb language: "He take book leave" (multiple verbs, no conjunction)

**Recommendation:** Analyze verb sequences in TBTA data to help serial verb languages.

---

## PART 3: Research Methodology for Tool Implementation

### Phase 1: Build Language Feature Database

1. **Create YAML database:** `/src/lib/tbta/language_features.yaml`

Structure:
```yaml
languages:
  jpn:
    name: Japanese
    family: Japonic
    features:
      - demonstrative_3way
      - honorific_grammatical

```

2. **Populate from this research**
3. **Cross-reference with eBible corpus** to verify which features are in available translations

### Phase 2: Map TBTA Values to Language Features

For each TBTA field value, identify which languages need that information:

```yaml
tbta_feature_mapping:
  number_trial:
    languages: [lar, mah, mva, tpi, bis, bhw]
    description: "Exactly 3 items - required in languages with trial number"

  person_first_inclusive:
    languages: [tgl, ind, zsm, fij, grn, que, mah]
    description: "We including addressee - grammatically distinct from exclusive"

  proximity_near_speaker:
    languages_3way: [jpn, kor, spa, por, ita, tur]
    description: "Proximal demonstrative - for 3-way systems"
```

### Phase 3: Test with Sample Verses

Use verses identified in plan:
- GEN 1:26 (Trial, First Inclusive)
- GEN 19:31 (Speaker demographics)
- GEN 4:8 (Participant tracking, entity disambiguation)
- Acts 15:25 (Inclusive vs. Exclusive)
- John 1:29 (Proximity markers)

### Phase 4: Exception Discovery

As tool runs:
- Document cases where TBTA marks a feature but no known language needs it
- Document cases where languages need a feature but TBTA doesn't mark it
- Update tool to handle mismatches gracefully

## PART 4: eBible Coverage Analysis (To Be Completed)

**Task:** Run analysis on eBible corpus to determine:

1. Which of the above languages are actually in eBible
2. How many total translations per language
3. Coverage by book/verse
4. Quality indicators (complete vs. partial translations)

**Create:** `/plan/tbta-languages/ebible-coverage-analysis.md`

## PART 5: Summary Statistics

**Features Researched:**

| Category | TBTA Has | Should Add | Total |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| Number systems | 6 (singular/dual/trial/quadrial/paucal/plural) | 0 | 6 |
| Person systems | 9 (1st/2nd/3rd + inclusive/exclusive + as-third) | 0 | 9 |
| Demonstratives | 9+ proximity categories | 0 | 9+ |
| Time granularity | 20+ temporal distinctions | 0 | 20+ |
| Speaker demographics | Age, relationship, attitude | 0 | Multiple |
| Participant tracking | 9 tracking states | 0 | 9 |
| Entity disambiguation | Noun list index | 0 | 1 |
| **Additional Features** | **Not in TBTA** | **Research Complete** | |
| Evidentiality | ❌ | ✅ 6 languages | 6 |
| Possession type | ❌ | ✅ Multiple | Many |
| Classifiers | ❌ | ✅ 9+ languages | Many |
| Gender systems (rare) | Partial? | ✅ Research done | - |

**Languages with Detailed Research:**

- **Trial number:** 7 languages (+ 3 debated)
- **Dual number:** 6 languages
- **Paucal number:** 6 languages
- **Inclusive/Exclusive:** 7 languages (+ many more documented)
- **Demonstratives (3-way):** 15+ languages
- **Honorifics:** 8 languages with grammatical systems
- **Switch-reference:** 5 specific + "hundreds" documented
- **Evidentiality:** 6 languages
- **Classifiers:** 9 languages
- **Possession types:** Oceanic family + Mayan languages

**Next Steps:**

1. ✅ Research complete for TBTA features
2. ✅ Research complete for additional features
3. ⏳ Create language feature database YAML
4. ⏳ Analyze eBible corpus coverage
5. ⏳ Build linguistic mapper tool
6. ⏳ Test on sample verses
