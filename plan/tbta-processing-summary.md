## Data Quality

### Successfully Processed
- ✅ All 11,649 JSON files from TBTA export
- ✅ All book name variants handled (e.g., "1_Samuel", "Revelations" typo)
- ✅ Nullish filtering applied (only "Not Applicable" and "Unspecified")
- ✅ All meaningful data preserved (Trial, First Inclusive, Space/Period, "No" values)
- ✅ SCHEMA.md compliant verse format (BOOK.chapter.verse)

### Book Name Mapping Issues Fixed
The following TBTA variations were mapped correctly:
- `1_Samuel` → 1SA
- `2_Samuel` → 2SA
- `1_Kings` → 1KI
- `2_Kings` → 2KI
- `1_Thessalonians` → 1TH
- `2_Thessalonians` → 2TH
- `2_John` → 2JN
- `Revelations` → REV (TBTA typo - should be "Revelation")

## Coverage Notes

### What TBTA Covers
TBTA provides partial Bible coverage focusing on:
- Complete narrative books (Genesis, Samuel, Kings)
- Complete Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)
- Select Epistles
- Select Prophets

### What TBTA Does NOT Cover
TBTA does not have data for ~20 books including:
- Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy
- Chronicles, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel
- Most Epistles (Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, etc.)
- James, Peter, Jude

This is **expected** - TBTA is a manually-created resource and they prioritized narrative and discourse-heavy books where cross-linguistic features are most relevant.

## File Structure

All files follow the standard pattern:
```
./bible/commentaries/{BOOK}/{chapter}/{verse}/{BOOK}-{chapter}-{verse}-tbta.yaml
```

Example:
```
./bible/commentaries/GEN/001/026/GEN-001-026-tbta.yaml
```

## Key Features Preserved

From spot checks on Genesis 1:26:
- ✅ Trial number (3 persons) for Trinity
- ✅ First Inclusive person marking
- ✅ Space and Period structural markers
- ✅ "No" boolean values (Implicit: 'No', Relativized: 'No')
- ✅ All discourse features (Speaker, Listener, Illocutionary Force)
- ✅ Participant tracking (Routine, Generic, Frame Inferable)

## Processing Time

- **11,649 verses in ~2.5 minutes** (~77 verses/second)
- Average file size: ~600 lines after nullish filtering

## Next Steps

- [x] All available TBTA data processed
- [ ] Document which verses/books are missing for future reference
- [ ] Consider processing additional Bible books if/when TBTA adds them

## Errors Encountered

**None** - all 11,649 files processed successfully with updated book name mappings.
