# TBTA Improvements & Additions

Track features TBTA may have missed or questionable annotations.

## Features TBTA Doesn't Have (But Languages Need)

### Evidentiality
**What it is:** Grammatical marking of information source (seen/heard/inferred/reported)

**Languages that need it:**
- Turkish, Quechua, many Amazonian languages

**Example:**
- "It rained" (I saw it) vs "It rained" (I'm told)
- Different verb forms required in many languages

**Coverage:** ~20% of world's languages require grammatical evidentiality

**Should we add?** Consider for future enhancement

---

### Noun Classifiers
**What it is:** Obligatory classifiers for nouns based on semantic category

**Languages that need it:**
- Mandarin, Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese (counters)

**Example:**
- English: "three books"
- Mandarin: "三本书" (sān běn shū) - "three [flat-object-classifier] book"

**Should we add?** May be useful for East Asian translations

---

### Alienable/Inalienable Possession
**What it is:** Different grammatical marking for possessions you can/cannot give away

**Languages that need it:**
- Many Austronesian, Polynesian, Native American languages

**Examples:**
- Inalienable: body parts, family relations ("my hand", "my father")
- Alienable: tools, possessions ("my book", "my house")
- Different pronouns/markers required

**Should we add?** Consider for comprehensive coverage

## Questionable TBTA Annotations

### Trial Number in GEN.1.26
**TBTA Value:** Trial (exactly 3)
**Issue:** Assumes Trinity interpretation
**Alternatives:**
- Pluralis maiestatis (royal "we")
- Divine council (God + angels)
- Literary device

**Verdict:** Needs review flag - theological interpretation required

---

### SemanticComplexityLevel Always '1'
**TBTA Value:** Always '1' in 100% of data
**Issue:** Appears to be placeholder, not actually implemented
**Should we:** Investigate if this should vary or drop the field
