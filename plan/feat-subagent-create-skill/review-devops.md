# DevOps Engineer Review

## Summary

This plan is architecturally interesting but operationally brittle. With 30-60 minutes per iteration and up to 7 iterations, you're looking at potentially 7 hours of runtime with no checkpointing, no progress visibility, and no clear recovery path when things fail. The system has 16 distinct failure points (1 main agent + 1 tool runner + 5 reviewers × 7 iterations) with vague error handling and no operational metrics. This will be painful to run and debug in practice.

## Reliability Concerns

### Failure Modes Identified

**1. Cascade Failures**
- If Tool Runner fails on verse 7/10, what happens? Do you lose all previous verses? The plan says "sequential processing" but not "incremental file writing with validation"
- If 1 of 5 parallel reviewers fails, do you proceed with 4 reviewers or abort? Plan doesn't specify
- If synthesis fails after reviewers complete, you've wasted ~30 minutes of work with no recovery

**2. Context Window Management**
- "Use compact feature for auto-summarization" and "reload context as needed" are not operational strategies
- Who detects context exhaustion? How? When?
- No defined strategy for what gets summarized vs. kept
- If context reload loses critical state, system could produce invalid output

**3. File System Failures**
- No validation that files were written successfully
- No checks that files are readable before next phase
- No handling for permission issues, disk full, or corrupted files
- Parallel reviewers all writing to same directory - potential race conditions on file system metadata

**4. Web Search Dependency**
- Tool Runner depends on web search for "factual verification"
- What happens when web search is unavailable, rate-limited, or returns no results?
- Plan says "Option C: Best effort" but doesn't define fallback behavior
- Could generate incomplete YAML that breaks subsequent phases

**5. Long-Running Operations Without Heartbeat**
- 30-60 minute iterations with no progress indication
- No way to distinguish "working normally" from "hung/crashed"
- Subagents could silently fail and you wouldn't know until timeout (what timeout?)

### What Will Actually Fail in Production

1. **The 3rd iteration will fail at 2am** because a web search times out and the Tool Runner doesn't handle it gracefully
2. **Reviewer subagent #4 will crash** on malformed YAML but the system will proceed with 4 reviews and produce inconsistent results
3. **Context window will exhaust on verse 8** and the auto-reload will lose the schema definition, causing invalid YAML generation
4. **You'll discover a bug in iteration 5** and have to start completely over because there's no checkpoint/resume capability
5. **The synthesis phase will produce empty output** because file encoding issues made reviewer files unreadable

## Error Handling Gaps

### Errors NOT Handled

**Phase 1 (Initialization):**
- Directory already exists (overwrite? abort? merge?)
- Parent directory doesn't exist or isn't writable
- Invalid tool name (special characters, path traversal attempts)

**Phase 2 (Execution):**
- Tool Runner produces invalid YAML (syntax errors, missing required fields)
- Tool Runner hangs/crashes mid-verse (verses 1-6 succeed, verse 7 hangs forever)
- Web search returns garbage/spam/offensive content
- Schema file is unreadable or malformed
- Output file writing fails silently

**Phase 3 (Review):**
- Partial reviewer failures (3/5 succeed)
- Reviewers produce feedback in wrong format
- Reviewers contradict each other completely (no consensus possible)
- Reviewer feedback is empty or nonsensical (hallucination)
- File locks/contention between parallel reviewers

**Phase 4 (Synthesis):**
- Synthesis produces no actionable changes (should this iterate or finalize?)
- Synthesis determines 8 iterations needed (exceeds limit of 7)
- Main agent crashes after reviewers complete but before synthesis

**Phase 5 (Iteration):**
- Cannot determine "problematic verses" from feedback
- Refined schema is less useful than previous version (regression)
- Iteration oscillates between two schema versions (infinite loop despite limit)

**Phase 6 (Finalization):**
- No "stellar insights" found in any verse
- README examples all come from same verse (not diverse)
- LEARNINGS.md synthesis cannot find common themes

### Recovery Mechanisms Missing

- **No retry logic specifics**: "Retry logic for transient failures" - how many times? Exponential backoff? What's transient?
- **No partial success handling**: If 4/5 reviewers succeed, should you retry the 5th or proceed?
- **No rollback**: If iteration 5 makes things worse, can you revert to iteration 4 schema?
- **No validation gates**: System doesn't verify output quality before proceeding to next phase
- **No circuit breakers**: If web search fails 10 times in a row, should you stop trying?

## Operational Issues

### Day-to-Day Running This System

**Problem 1: No Visibility**
- You run this, wait 45 minutes, and get an error. Where did it fail? What was it doing?
- No progress indicators: "Processing verse 7/10", "Reviewer 3/5 complete", "Iteration 4/7"
- No timestamps in output: When did each phase start/end?
- No duration tracking: Is this iteration slower than normal?

**Problem 2: Can't Intervene**
- System runs for 6 hours across 7 iterations
- You notice iteration 3 produced bad output
- You want to adjust and continue, but you can't - must start over or manually edit files and hope

**Problem 3: Debugging is Archaeology**
- Something went wrong in iteration 4
- You have to manually read through files in rev4/ directory
- Reviewer feedback is unstructured prose - hard to parse for errors
- No error logs, stack traces, or diagnostic output
- Tool Runner YAML might be silently wrong (valid YAML, wrong content)

**Problem 4: Resource Management**
- Running 5 parallel subagents - what's the memory footprint?
- What's the token cost? (10 verses × YAML generation + 5 reviewers × reading 10 YAML files × up to 7 iterations = huge)
- No cost estimates, no budget limits, no overspending protection

**Problem 5: Environment Assumptions**
- Assumes file system is reliable and fast
- Assumes network (web search) is available
- Assumes sufficient context window in all subagents
- Assumes main orchestrator doesn't crash/restart
- None of these are guaranteed in practice

### Manual Interventions Needed

Based on this plan, you'll manually intervene to:
1. **Restart failed iterations** (no automated retry with corrected input)
2. **Fix malformed YAML** (no validation catches it early)
3. **Resolve reviewer conflicts** (synthesis can't handle complete disagreement)
4. **Adjust quality threshold** (no clear criteria for "major issues" vs "minor issues")
5. **Clean up partial runs** (failed runs leave incomplete directory structures)
6. **Monitor context window** (no automated detection/handling)
7. **Verify web search citations** (reviewers might catch hallucinations, might not)

### How Do You Know If It's Working?

**Right now: You don't.**

The plan lists success metrics like "✅ Processes all 10 verses with valid YAML" but doesn't say:
- How do you verify YAML is valid? (syntax check? schema validation? semantic correctness?)
- What constitutes "valid" YAML? (parseable? includes required fields? theologically accurate?)
- How do you know reviewers "spawned successfully" vs. "spawned but crashed immediately"?

## Monitoring & Observability

### What We Need to Track

**Real-Time Operational Metrics:**
```
System Health:
- Current phase: "initialization" | "execution" | "review" | "synthesis" | "iteration" | "finalization"
- Current iteration: N/7
- Phase progress: "verse 7/10" | "reviewer 3/5 complete"
- Time in current phase: duration since phase started
- Last activity timestamp: when was last file written?

Performance Metrics:
- Verse processing time: avg/min/max seconds per verse
- Reviewer duration: avg/min/max minutes per reviewer
- Iteration duration: minutes per iteration
- Total runtime: elapsed time since start

Quality Metrics:
- YAML validation pass rate: % of verses with valid YAML
- Required fields present: % completeness per verse
- Web search success rate: % of lookups that succeeded
- Reviewer consensus score: how often reviewers agree?

Error Metrics:
- Tool Runner failures: count by verse, reason
- Reviewer failures: count by persona, reason
- Web search failures: count by verse
- File I/O errors: count by operation type
- Context window exhaustions: count by agent

Resource Metrics:
- Token usage: per agent, per phase, total
- File count: files created per iteration
- Disk usage: bytes written
- Memory usage: per subagent (if measurable)
```

**Logs Required:**
```

[2025-10-28 15:15:01] [REVIEWER_translator] Skipping malformed file, continuing review
```

**Dashboards Needed:**
1. **Real-time progress**: Current phase, iteration N/7, time elapsed, estimated time remaining
2. **Error tracking**: Failed operations, retry counts, error types
3. **Quality trends**: YAML validation rate, reviewer consensus improving/declining over iterations
4. **Resource usage**: Token costs, file sizes, disk usage

### Debugging Capabilities Missing

**When iteration 4 fails, you need to know:**
1. Which specific verse processing failed and why
2. What was the last successful operation
3. What's the state of the file system (which files exist, are they valid?)
4. What were the reviewers actually reviewing (content, not just filenames)
5. What did the synthesis logic decide and why

**Currently the plan provides:**
1. Files in directories (manual inspection required)
2. Whatever error message happened to be returned (if any)
3. No structured diagnostics

## Recommendations

### Critical (Do These or Don't Build This)

**1. Add Comprehensive State Machine with Checkpointing**
```
State file: ./{tool-name}/.state.json
{
  "current_phase": "execution",
  "iteration": 4,
  "verses_completed": ["JHN-1-1", "MAT-5-3", "COL-3-1"],
  "verses_failed": [],
  "reviewers_completed": ["theologian", "translator"],
  "reviewers_failed": [],
  "last_activity": "2025-10-28T15:32:11Z",
  "errors": [],
  "can_resume": true
}
```

**Why:** Enables resume after failure, provides progress visibility, allows intervention

**2. Implement Validation Gates Between Phases**
```
Before Phase 3 (Review):
✓ Verify all 10 YAML files exist
✓ Validate YAML syntax in each file
✓ Check required schema fields present
✓ Verify web search citations included
✗ If any fail: STOP, report errors, allow manual fix or retry

Before Phase 4 (Synthesis):
✓ Verify all 5 reviewer files exist
✓ Check reviewer files are non-empty
✓ Validate markdown structure
✗ If any fail: STOP, report errors, retry failed reviewers
```

**Why:** Catches errors early, prevents cascading failures, reduces wasted work

**3. Define Explicit Retry Policy**
```
Transient errors (retry with exponential backoff):
- Web search timeout (3 retries, 5s, 10s, 20s)
- File write temporarily failed (3 retries, 1s, 2s, 4s)
- Subagent spawn failed (2 retries, 10s, 30s)

Permanent errors (fail fast, log, allow manual intervention):
- Invalid schema definition
- Malformed YAML after Tool Runner completion
- All reviewers failed
- Synthesis produced empty output
- Iteration limit exceeded

Partial failures (configurable threshold):
- 4/5 reviewers succeeded: PROCEED (log warning)
- 3/5 reviewers succeeded: STOP (require manual decision)
- 7/10 verses succeeded: STOP (require fix or skip verses)
```

**Why:** Predictable behavior, reduces false failures, enables automation

**4. Add Structured Logging with Levels**
```
INFO:  Phase transitions, major operations
DEBUG: Individual verse processing, file operations
WARN:  Retries, degraded operation (4/5 reviewers)
ERROR: Operation failures with context
FATAL: Unrecoverable errors requiring intervention

All logs include:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- Agent ID (main, tool_runner, reviewer_theologian)
- Iteration number
- Phase name
- Structured data (JSON fields, not prose)
```

**Why:** Essential for debugging, monitoring, and understanding system behavior

**5. Implement Progress Reporting**
```
Tool Runner:
- "Processing verse 7/10: Daniel 9:25 (estimated 2 minutes remaining)"
- "Web search 2/3 for Daniel 9:25: 'Seventy weeks prophecy scholarly'"

Reviewers:
- "Reviewer 3/5 (engineer) completed in 12.3 minutes"
- "Waiting for 2 reviewers: translator (running 15.2 min), pastor (running 14.8 min)"

Iterations:
- "Iteration 4/7 complete in 47 minutes (avg: 42 min/iteration)"
- "Estimated total time remaining: 2.1 hours"
```

**Why:** User sanity, enables intervention decisions, debugging

### High Priority (Do These for Production Readiness)

**6. Add Health Checks and Timeouts**
```
Tool Runner:
- Verse timeout: 5 minutes (if exceeded, flag verse as failed, continue to next)
- Heartbeat: Log progress every 30 seconds
- Web search timeout: 30 seconds per search

Reviewers:
- Review timeout: 20 minutes (if exceeded, fail that reviewer)
- Heartbeat: Log progress every 60 seconds

Overall:
- Maximum iteration time: 90 minutes (if exceeded, fail iteration gracefully)
- Maximum total runtime: 8 hours (safety limit)
```

**Why:** Prevents infinite hangs, enables detection of stuck operations

**7. Add Output Validation and Sanitization**
```
YAML Output Validation:
- Syntax check: YAML parser succeeds
- Schema validation: Required fields present
- Content validation: No empty strings in required fields
- Citation check: URLs present and roughly valid format
- Size check: File between 1KB and 100KB (sanity bounds)

Reviewer Feedback Validation:
- Non-empty file
- Contains expected markdown headers
- Minimum word count (e.g., 200 words)
- No signs of hallucination ("I don't have access to...", "As an AI...")
```

**Why:** Early detection of bad output, prevent garbage in = garbage out

**8. Implement Graceful Degradation**
```
Reviewer Failures:
- 5/5 succeed: Optimal, proceed normally
- 4/5 succeed: Acceptable, log warning, proceed
- 3/5 succeed: Degraded, require manual decision
- <3/5 succeed: Failed, retry all reviewers once

Web Search Failures:
- Success: Include citation in YAML
- Failure: Mark field as "NOT_VERIFIED", include in YAML
- Multiple failures: Continue with warnings, flag for human review

Context Window Issues:
- Tool Runner: Save progress, reload context with schema + current verse only
- Reviewers: Review in batches (2 verses at a time if needed)
- Synthesis: Reload with executive summary of each reviewer's feedback
```

**Why:** System continues to function even when components partially fail

**9. Add Resource Limits and Cost Tracking**
```
Token Budget:
- Tool Runner: 100K tokens per verse (abort if exceeded)
- Reviewer: 50K tokens per review (abort if exceeded)
- Synthesis: 30K tokens per iteration (abort if exceeded)
- Log actual usage vs. budget

File System Limits:
- Maximum 100 YAML files per revision (safety limit)
- Maximum file size: 100KB per YAML (sanity check)
- Verify disk space before writing (require 100MB free)

Cost Estimation:
- Log: "Estimated cost for this iteration: $X.XX"
- Accumulate total cost across iterations
- Warning if total cost exceeds configurable threshold
```

**Why:** Prevents runaway costs, resource exhaustion

**10. Create Operations Runbook**
```
# Operations Runbook

## Common Failures

### "Tool Runner hung on verse 7"
Symptoms: No progress for >5 minutes
Diagnosis: Check .state.json for last_activity timestamp
Resolution:
  1. Check verse 7 YAML file exists and is valid
  2. If exists: Resume from verse 8
  3. If not exists: Restart Tool Runner with verses [7-10]

### "Reviewer consensus impossible"
Symptoms: Synthesis says "divergent views, cannot proceed"
Diagnosis: Read all 5 reviewer files, identify contradictions
Resolution:
  1. If genuinely contradictory: Manual schema refinement required
  2. If reviewers misunderstood: Improve reviewer instructions, retry
  3. If one reviewer is outlier: Exclude that reviewer, re-run synthesis

[... more failure modes with runbook entries ...]
```

**Why:** Reduces MTTR, enables non-experts to operate system

### Nice to Have (Future Improvements)

**11. Add Automated Quality Scoring**
- YAML completeness score: % of schema fields populated
- Citation density: # citations per 100 words of output
- Reviewer consensus: % agreement across reviewers
- Improvement trend: Quality score delta between iterations

**12. Implement Parallel Verse Processing**
- Once Tool Runner is stable, spawn multiple instances
- Requires solving nested subagent limitation or using different orchestration

**13. Add Dry-Run Mode**
- Validate schema without running experiments
- Estimate cost and duration
- Verify directory structure and permissions

**14. Create Web UI for Monitoring**
- Real-time progress visualization
- Error dashboard
- Quality metrics over time
- Manual intervention controls (pause/resume/skip)

## Bottom Line: Ship or Skip?

**Skip this iteration.** The plan is conceptually sound but operationally immature.

**Why:**
- 7 hours of runtime with no checkpointing = guaranteed frustration
- Vague error handling = system will fail in unpredictable ways
- No observability = impossible to debug when (not if) it fails
- No validation gates = cascading failures waste hours of compute

**What needs to happen before this is shippable:**
1. Implement state machine with checkpointing (Recommendation #1)
2. Add validation gates between phases (Recommendation #2)
3. Define explicit retry policy (Recommendation #3)
4. Add structured logging (Recommendation #4)
5. Implement progress reporting (Recommendation #5)

**With those 5 changes, this becomes operational. Without them, you're building a time bomb.**

The good news: These are all known problems with known solutions. The architecture is reasonable. The risks are well-identified. You just need to take operations seriously from the start, not bolt it on later when things break in production.
