# List of potential ideas for tools to build

## Word Analysis
- [ ] Foreach word in the source languages analyze every lexicon, concordance (Strong's, Youngs) etc to extract all it's meaning and forms
- [ ] Foreach language foreach word find all verses that use that word and reverse engineer it to the source language and the gateway languages
- [ ] Process https://github.com/BibleAquifer/ACAI similar to how we did ebible by cloning it to tmp then go through each of its parts, should end up in the word and topic data and aliases should be made to key words
- [ ] Tyndales Dictionary of all words is avalable here https://github.com/BibleAquifer/AquiferOpenBibleDictionary and we could read them and add them to the right files

## Bible Translation 
- [ ] Foreach source language word look it up in our word files, identify which definitions and forms match in this exact context

## Theology
- [ ] what are the different interpretations of this text and the arguements for and against each

## Context
- [ ] foreach verse how does the cultural context affect it
- [ ] what are parallel passages and related scriptures and what impact do they have on this meaning (compare, contrast, amplify)

## Outline
- [ ] foreach book, chapter break it down into potential outlines

## Commentaries
- [ ] Tyndale Open study notes can be read here. https://github.com/BibleAquifer/AquiferOpenStudyNotes It would be best to read the entire file and write to individual commentary files, appending to other notes
